Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my little price sitting on top of a wall, with his feet dangling. And I heard him say:	在井旁边有一堵残缺的石墙。第二天晚上我工作回来的时候，我远远地看见了小王子耷拉着双腿坐在墙上。我听见他在说话：
"Then you don't remember. This is not the exact spot."	“你怎么不记得了呢？绝不是在这儿。”
Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it:	大概还有另一个声音在回答他，因为他答着腔说道：
"Yes, yes! It is the right day, but this is not the place."	“没错，没错，日子是对的；但地点不是这里……”
I continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. The little prince, however, replied once again:	我继续朝墙走去。我还是看不到，也听不见任何别人。可是小王子又回答道：
"Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight."	“那当然。你会在沙上看到我的脚印是从什么地方开始的。你在那里等着我就行了。今天夜里我去那里。”
I was only twenty metres from the wall, and I still saw nothing.	我离墙约有二十米远，可我依然什么也没有看见。
"You have good poison? You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long?"	“你的毒液管用吗？你保证不会使我长时间地痛苦吗？”
I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand.	我焦虑地赶上前去，但我仍然不明白是怎么回事。
"Now go away," said the little prince. "I want to get down."	“现在你去吧，我要下来了！”小王子说。
I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall-- and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end. Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones.	于是，我也朝墙脚下看去，我吓了一跳。就在那里，一条黄蛇直起身子冲着小王子。这种黄蛇半分钟就能结果你的性命。我一面赶紧掏口袋，拔出手枪，一面跑过去。可是一听到我的脚步声，蛇却像一股干涸了的水柱一样，慢慢钻进沙里去。它不慌不忙地在石头的缝隙中钻动着，发出轻轻的金属般的响声。
I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow.	我到达墙边的时候，正好把我的这位小王子接在我的怀抱中。他的脸色雪一样惨白。
I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone's rifle…	我解开了他一直戴着的金黄色的围脖。我用水渍湿了他的太阳穴，让他喝了点水。这时，我什么也不敢再问他。他严肃地看着我，用双臂搂着我的脖子。我感到他的心就象一只被枪弹击中而濒于死亡的鸟的心脏一样在跳动着。
"I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine," he said. "Now you can go back home--"	他说：“我很高兴，你找到了你的机器所缺少的东西。你不久就可以回家去了……”
I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope.	我正是来告诉他，在没有任何希望的情况下，我成功地完成了修理工作。
I realised clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him…	我清楚地感到发生了某种不寻常的事。我把他当作小孩一样紧紧抱在怀里，可是我感觉到他径直地向着一个无底深渊沉陷下去，我想法拉住他，却怎么也办不到……
"I have your sheep. And I have the sheep's box. And I have the muzzle…"	“我有你画的羊，羊的箱子和羊的嘴套子……”
I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little.	我等了很长时间，才觉得他身子渐渐暖和起来。
Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.	我再度意识到要发生一件不可弥补的事。我觉得我的心一下子就凉了。这时我才明白：一想到再也不能听到这笑声，我就不能忍受。这笑声对我来说，就好像是沙漠中的甘泉一样。
"Tonight, it will be a year… my star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago…"	“到今天夜里，正好是一年了。我的星球将正好处于我去年降落的那个地方的上空……”
"Little man," I said, "tell me that it is only a bad dream-- this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star…"	“小家伙，这蛇的事，约会的事，还有星星，这全是一场噩梦吧？”
But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead: "The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen…"	但他并不回答我的问题。他对我说：“重要的事，是看不见的……”
"It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers…"	“这就像花一样。如果你爱上了一朵生长在一颗星星上的花，那么夜间，你看着天空就感到甜蜜愉快。所有的星星上都好像开着花。”
"It is just as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music. You remember-- how good it was."	“这也就像水一样，由于那辘轳和绳子的缘故，你给我喝的井水好像音乐一样……你记得吗？……这水非常好喝……”
"And at night you will look up at the stars. Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found. It is better, like that. My star will just be one of the stars, for you. And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens… they will all be your friends. And, besides, I am going to make you a present…"	“夜晚，你抬头望着星星，我的那颗太小了，我无法给你指出我的那颗星星是在哪里。这样倒更好。你可以认为我的那颗星星就在这些星星之中。那么，所有的星星，你都会喜欢看的……这些星星都将成为你的朋友。而且，我还要给你一件礼物……”
"Ah, little prince, dear little prince! I love to hear that laughter!"	“啊！小家伙，小家伙，我喜欢听你这笑声！”
"All men have the stars," he answered, "but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems. For my businessman they were wealth. But all these stars are silent. You-- you alone-- will have the stars as no one else has them--"	“人们眼里的星星并不都一样。对旅行的人来说，星星是向导。对别的人来说，星星只是些小亮光。对另外一些学者来说，星星就是他们探讨的学问。对我所遇见的那个实业家来说，星星是金钱。但是，所有这些星星都不会说话。你呢，你的那些星星将是任何人都不曾有过的……”
"In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night… you-- only you-- will have stars that can laugh!"	“夜晚，当你望着天空的时候，既然我就住在其中一颗星星上，既然我在其中一颗星星上笑着，那么对你来说，就好像所有的星星都在笑，那么你将看到的星星就是会笑的星星！”
"And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure… and your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, 'Yes, the stars always make me laugh！' And they will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you…"	“那么，在你的悲伤平息之后（时间会缓和所有的悲伤）你就会因为认识了我而感到高兴。你将永远是我的朋友。你就会想要同我一起笑。有时，你会为了快乐而不知不觉地打开窗户。你的朋友们会奇怪地看着你笑着仰望天空。那时，你就可以对他们说：‘是的，星星总是引我欢笑！’他们会以为你发疯了。我的恶作剧将使你难堪……”
"It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh…"	“这就好像我并没有给你星星，而是给你一大堆会笑出声来的小铃铛……”
"I shall look as if I were suffering. I shall look a little as if I were dying. It is like that. Do not come to see that. It is not worth the trouble…"	“我将会像是很痛苦的样子……我有点像要死去似的。就是这么回事，你就别来看这些了，没有必要。”
"I tell you-- it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you. Snakes-- they are malicious creatures. This one might bite you just for fun…"	“我对你说这些……这也是因为蛇的缘故。别让它咬了你……蛇是很坏的，它随意咬人……”
"It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite."	“对了，它咬第二口的时候就没有毒液了……”
That night I did not see him set out on his way. He got away from me without making a sound. When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step. He said to me merely:	这天夜里，我没有看到他起程。他不声不响地跑了。当我终于赶上他的时候，他坚定地快步走着。他只是对我说道：
"It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true…"	“你不该这样。你会难受的。我会像是死去的样子，但这不会是真的……”
"You understand… it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy."	“你明白，路很远。我不能带着这付身躯走。它太重了。”
"But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells…"	“但是，这就好像剥落的旧树皮一样。旧树皮，并没有什么可悲的。”
"You know, it will be very nice. I, too, shall look at the stars. All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink…"	“这将是蛮好的，你知道。我也一定会看星星的。所有的星星都将是带有生了锈的辘轳的井。所有的星星都会倒水给我喝……”
"That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water…"	“这将是多么好玩啊！你将有五亿个铃铛，我将有五亿口水井……”
And he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, again:	他这时坐下来，因为他害怕了。他却仍然说道：
"You know-- my flower… I am responsible for her. And she is so weak! She is so nae! She has four thorns, of no use at all, to protect herself against all the world…"	“你知道……我的花……我是要对她负责的！而她又是那么弱小！她又是那么天真。她只有四根微不足道的刺，保护自己，抵抗外敌……”
I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer.	我也坐了下来，因为我再也站立不住了。
He still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one step. I could not move.	他犹豫了一下，然后站起来。他迈出了一步。而我却动弹不得。
There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand.	在他的脚踝子骨附近，一道黄光闪了一下。刹那间他一动也不动了。他没有叫喊。他轻轻地像一棵树一样倒在地上，大概由于沙地的缘故，连一点响声都没有。
The next day was foggy. Everything on the farm was dripping wet. The grass looked like a magic carpet. The asparagus patch looked like a silver forest.	第二天起雾了。农场里的一切都被雾水打湿了。草地看起来像有魔力的地毯。龙须菜地看起来则像一片银色的森林。
On foggy mornings, Charlotte's web was truly a thing of beauty. This morning each thin strand was decorated with dozens of tiny beads of water. The web glistened in the light and made a pattern of loveliness and mystery, like a delicate veil. Even Lurvy, who wasn't particularly interested in beauty, noticed the web when he came with the pig's breakfast. He noted how clearly it showed up and he noted how big and carefully built it was. And then he took another look and he saw something that made him set his pail down. There, in the center of the web, neatly woven in block letters, was a message.	晨雾中，夏洛的网显得异常的绮丽。每一缕细细的丝线上都缀满无数的小珠子。这张在晨光中泛着莹光的网，里面织着可爱而又神秘的图案，看起来就如同一层纤美的面纱。即使从来对美丽不是很在意的鲁维，在给威伯送早饭时也注意到了这张网。他注意到这网被编织得有多么大，多么的精致。当他再看时，发现了某种使他吃惊的事，慌乱中不觉扔下了食桶。那儿，就在网的中心，织着两排漂亮的大写字母，好像是在传达某种信息。
Then, forgetting all about Wilbur's breakfast, he walked back to the house and called Mr. Zuckerman.	“我看到什么了？”他喃喃说着，跌跪下去，急急地祈祷了一番。然后，他忙回到房子里去喊祖克曼先生，全没想到威伯的早餐。
"What’s the trouble?” asked Mr. Zuckerman. “Anything wrong with the pig?"	“怎么了？”祖克曼先生问，“猪出什么毛病了吗？”
The two men walked silently down to Wilbur's yard. Lurvy pointed to the spider's web. "Do you see what I see?" he asked.	两个男人悄悄来到威伯的院子里。鲁维指向那蜘蛛网。“你看我看见了什么？”他问。
Zuckerman stared at the writing on the web. Then he murmured the words "Some Pig." Then he looked at Lurvy. Then they both began to tremble. Charlotte, sleepy after her night's exertions, smiled as she watched. Wilbur came and stood directly under the web.	祖克曼先生盯着网上的字母，念着上面的“好猪”这个词。然后他看了看鲁维。这时他们都开始哆嗦了。昨夜忙碌了一宿的夏洛，此刻已经醒来，正微笑着看着这一切。威伯一直朝网这边走过来。
"Some pig!" Whispered Mr. Zuckerman. They stared and stared for a long time at Wilbur. Then they stared at Charlotte.	“好猪！”祖克曼先生低语。接下来的很长一段时间里，他们只是把威伯看了又看，然后才朝夏洛看去。
"You don't suppose that that spider..." began Mr. Zuckerman--but he shook his head and didn't finish the sentence. Instead, he walked solemnly back up to the house and spoke to his wife. "Edith, something has happened," he said, in a weak voice. He went into the living room and sat down and Mrs. Zuckerman followed.	“你不是猜是那…那只蜘蛛……”祖克曼先生摇摇头，没再继续说下去。他神色庄重地回到房子里，把这事情说给他的太太听。“伊迪丝，某种事情发生了，”他嗫嚅着，走进起居室坐下。祖克曼太太跟了过来。
"I've got something to tell you, Edith," he said. "You better sit down."	“我有些话要告诉你，伊迪丝，”他说，“你最好还是坐下来。”
"Edith," he said, trying to keep his voice steady, "I think you had best be told that we have a very unusual pig."	“伊迪丝，”他试着让他的声音听起来不那么激动，“我想你最好知道，我们有了一头极不寻常的猪。”
A look of complete bewilderment came over Mrs. Zuckerman's face. "Homer Zuckerman, what in the world are you talking about?" she said. 	祖克曼太太的脸上显出一副迷惑不解的神情。“霍默·祖克曼，你到底想要说什么？”她说。
"This is a very serious thing, Edith," he replied. "Our pig is completely out of the ordinary."	“这是一件非常严肃的事情，伊迪丝，”他回答道，“我们的猪完全是出类拔萃的。”
"What’s unusual about the pig?” asked Mrs. Zuckerman, who was beginning to recover from her scare.	“这猪有什么特别的地方？”祖克曼太太问着，开始不那么害怕了。
"Well, I don't really know yet," said Mr. Zuckerman. "But we have received a sign, Edith--a mysterious sign. A miracle has happened on this farm. There is a large spider's web in the doorway of the barn cellar, right over the pigpen, and when Lurvy went to feed the pig this morning, he noticed the web because it was foggy, and you know how a spider's web looks very distinct in a fog. And right spang in the middle of the web there were the words 'Some Pig.' The words were woven right into the web. They were actually part of the web, Edith. I know, because I have been down there and seen them. It says, 'Some Pig,' just as clear as clear can be. There can be no mistake about it. A miracle has happened and a sign has occurred hereon earths right on our farm, and we have no ordinary pig." 	“嗯，我也不知道该怎么说，”祖克曼先生说，“我们得到了一个暗示，伊迪丝——一个神秘的暗示。一个奇迹已经在这个农场上出现了。谷仓地窖门口有一个大蜘蛛网，它就在猪圈上边。今早我和鲁维去喂猪时，因为雾的关系他看到了那张网，你知道一张蜘蛛网在雾里显得有些特别。就在网的中央，写着‘好猪’这个词。这个词完全是由蜘蛛网织出来的。它们本身就是网的一部分，伊迪丝。我知道这点，因为我在那儿看到了它。那上面写着的‘好猪’，看起来再清楚不过了。我绝不能看错的。一个奇迹发生了，一个神示在地球上出现了，它就在我们的农场，我们有了一头不同凡响的猪。”
"Well," said Mrs. Zuckerman, "it seems to me you're a little off. It seems to me we have no ordinary spider." 	“哦，”祖克曼太太说，“我觉得你好像弄拧了。我看我们是有了一头不同凡响的蜘蛛才对。”
“Oh, no,” said Zuckerman. “It’s the pig that’s unusual. It says so, right there in the middle of the web.” 	“噢，不！”祖克曼说，“是这猪不一般，那蜘蛛网的中间就这么说的。”
“Maybe so,” said Mrs. Zuckerman. “Just the same, I intend to have a look at that spider.”	“可能如此吧，”祖克曼太太说，“虽然如此，我还是打算去看看那只蜘蛛。”
They got up, and together they walked down to Wilbur’s yard. “You see, Edith? It’s just a common grey spider.”	他们站起来，一同往威伯的院子走。“你看到了吗，伊迪丝？它是只很平常的灰蜘蛛。”
Wilbur was pleased to receive so much attention. Lurvy was still standing there, and Mr. And Mrs. Zuckerman, all three, stood for about an hour, reading the words on the web over and over, and watching Wilbur.	威伯很高兴能如此引人注目。还在那儿站着的鲁维，祖克曼先生和太太，三个人一起在那里站了大约一小时，一遍遍地读着网里的词，并观察着威伯。
Charlotte was delighted with the way her trick was working. She sat without moving a muscle, and listened to the conversation of the people. When a small fly blundered into the web, just beyond the word “pig,” Charlotte dropped quickly down, rolled the fly up, and carried it out of the way.	夏洛为她成功地愚弄了这些人而开心。她一动不动地坐在那里，听着人们的交谈。一只小苍蝇撞到网里，马上就要朝“猪”这个字爬过来了。夏洛见了忙跑过去把苍蝇缠住，拖远。
After a while the fog lifted. The web dried off and the words didn’t show up so plainly. The Zuckermans and Lurvy walked back to the house. Just before they left the pigpen, Mr. Zuckerman took one last look at Wilbur.	不久，雾散了。网也干了，这些字母看起来也不那么美了。祖克曼夫妇和鲁维走回了房子。在离开猪圈前，祖克曼先生最后又看了威伯一眼。
“You know,” he said, in an important voice, “I’ve thought all along that that pig of ours was an extra good one. He’s a solid pig. That pig is as solid as they come. You notice how solid he is around the shoulders, Lurvy?”	“你知道，”他庄重地说，“我想从哪方面看我们的猪都格外的优秀。他是头很结实的猪，比别的猪都壮实。你注意到他的肩膀下有多么结实吗，鲁维？”
“Sure, Sure I do,” said Lurvy. “I’ve always noticed that pig. He’s quite a pig.”	“当然，当然，”鲁维说，“我总是注意那头猪。他是头不一般的猪。”
“He’s long, and he’s smooth,” said Zuckerman.	“他是那么的长，身上那么的光滑。”祖克曼说。
“That’s right,” agreed Lurvy. “he’s as smooth as they come. He’s some pig.”	“的确，”鲁维表示同意，“他比别的猪光滑得多。他是头好猪。”
When Mr. Zuckerman got back to the house, he took off his work clothes and put on his best suit. Then he got into his car and drove to the minister’s house. He stayed for an hour and explained to the minister that a miracle had happened on the farm.	祖克曼先生回到了家，便脱下工作服，穿上了他最好的衣裳。然后他进了他的车，向牧师家驶去。他在牧师那里花了一小时，讲述在他的农场出现的奇迹。
“So far,” said Zuckerman, “only four people on earth know about this miracle—myself, my wife Edith, my hired man Lurvy, and you.”	“到现在为止，”祖克曼说，“这个地球上只有四个人知道这个奇迹——我，我妻子伊迪丝，我的雇工鲁维，还有你。”
“Don’t tell anybody else,” said the minister. “We don’t know what it means yet, but perhaps if I give thought to it, I can explain it in my sermon next Sunday. There can be no doubt that you have a most unusual pig. I intend to speak about it in my sermon and point out the fact that this community has been visited with a wondrous animal. By the way, does the pig have a name?”	“先别对任何人说，”牧师说，“我们还不知道那预示着什么，但如果我思考一下，就能在下周的布道会上解释这一切。无疑，你有了一头最不寻常的猪。我打算在我的布道会上指出，这个社区出现了一种多么不寻常的动物。顺便问一句，那猪有名字吗？”
“Why, yes,” said Mr. Zuckerman. “My little niece calls him Wilbur. She’s rather queer child—full of notions. She raised the pig on a bottle and I bought him from her when he was a month old.”	“是的，有，”祖克曼先生说,“我的小外甥女叫他威伯。她是个相当古怪的小孩——脑子里都是奇特的念头。她用奶瓶给这头猪喂奶，当小猪一个月大时，我才把他从她那里买来的。”
Secrets are hard to keep. Long before Sunday came, the news spread all over the county. Everybody knew that a sign had appeared in a spider’s web on the Zuckerman place. Everybody knew that the Zuckermans had a wondrous pig. People came from miles around to look at Wilbur and to read the words on Charlotte’s web. The Zuckermans’ driveway was full of cars and trucks from morning till night—Fords and Chevvies and Buick roadmasters and GMC pickups and Plymouths and Studebakers and Packards and De Sotos with gyromatic transmissions and Oldsmobiles with rocket engines and Jeep station wagons and Pontiacs. The news of the wonderful pig spread clear up into the hills, and farmers came rattling down in buggies and buckboards, to stand hour after hour at Wilbur’s pen admiring the miraculous animal. All said they had never seen such a pig before in their lives.	秘密是很难被保住的。远在星期日到来之前，这消息就传遍了整个村子。每个人都知道一个神示在祖克曼先生家的蜘蛛网里出现了。每个人都知道祖克曼一家有了一头奇异的猪。人们从四面八方赶来看威伯，读着夏洛的网里的字。祖克曼家的车道上从早到晚都停满了小车和大卡车——福特，雪佛莱，别克，通用皮卡、普利茅斯、斯塔德贝克、帕卡德、带陀螺变速器的德索托、带火箭引擎的奥兹莫比尔、旅行吉普和庞蒂亚克牌汽车等等都开过来了。这头神奇的小猪的消息也传进了山里，那些农场主们都赶着他们各式的马车来了，一小时接一小时地在威伯的猪圈里艳羡地看着这头神奇的动物。所有人都声称在一生中从没见过这样的猪。
When Fern told her mother that Avery had tried to hit the Zuckermans’ spider with a stick, Mrs. Arable was so shocked that she sent Avery to bed without any supper, as punishment.	当芬把埃弗里曾想把祖克曼的蜘蛛用棍子打下来的事告诉了她的妈妈后，阿拉贝尔太太一怒之下没让埃弗里吃晚饭，就把他赶上了床，以示惩罚。
In the days that followed, Mr. Zuckerman was so busy entertaining visitors that he neglected his farm work. He wore his good clothes all the time now—got right into them when he got up in the morning. Mrs. Zuckerman prepared special meals for Wilbur. Lurvy shaved and got a haircut; and his principal farm duty was to feed the pig while people looked on.	接下去的几天里，祖克曼先生由于整天忙着招待这些来访者，竟然忘记了他的农活。他时刻穿着他最好的衣服——早上一起床就往人群里走。祖克曼太太给威伯准备了特别的饭菜。鲁维刮了脸，也理了发；他在农场里最首要的任务就是在人们来参观时喂那头猪。
Mr. Zuckerman ordered Lurvy to increase Wilbur’s feedings from three meals a day to four meals a day. The Zuckermans were so busy with visitors they forgot about other things on the farm. The blackberries got ripe, and Mrs. Zuckerman failed to put up any blackberry jam. The corn needed hoeing, and Lurvy didn’t find time to hoe it.	祖克曼先生命令鲁维把威伯的吃饭次数从一天三次增加到四次。祖克曼一家如此忙于应付这些来访的人众，都忘了农场里还有别的事情要做了。黑莓熟了，可祖克曼太太却忘了把它们采摘，做成果酱。玉米地需要锄草了，可鲁维却找不到时间去锄草。
On Sunday the church was full. The minister explained the miracle. He said that the words on the spider’s web proved that human beings must always be on the watch for the coming of wonders.	星期日，教堂挤满了人。牧师对这奇迹解释了一通。他说这蜘蛛网上的字说明，人类必须时刻准备去观察神迹的出现。
All in all, the Zuckermans’ pigpen was the center of attraction. Fern was happy, for she felt that Charlotte’s trick was working and that Wilbur’s life would be saved. But she found that the barn was not nearly as pleasant—too many people. She liked it better when she could be all alone with her friends the animals.	祖克曼家的猪圈成了众人注意的焦点。芬很开心，因为她知道夏洛的把戏取得了成效，威伯的命也保住了。只是她觉得谷仓里现在不那么令她高兴了——那里的人太多了。她更愿意能和她的动物朋友单独在一起。
"Men," said the little prince, "set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round…"	“那些人们，他们往快车里拥挤，但是他们却不知道要寻找什么。于是，他们就忙忙碌碌，来回转圈子……”小王子说道。
The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand. This one was like a well in a village. But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming…	我们终于找到的这口井，不同于撒哈拉的那些井。撒哈拉的井只是沙漠中挖的洞。这口井则很象村子中的井。可是，那里又没有任何村庄，我还以为是在做梦呢。
"It is strange," I said to the little prince. "Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope…"	“真怪，”我对小王子说：“一切都是现成的：辘轳、水桶、绳子……”
He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten.	他笑了，拿着绳子，转动着辘轳。辘轳就像是一个长期没有风来吹动的旧风标一样，吱吱作响。
"Do you hear?" said the little prince. "We have wakened the well, and it is singing…"	“你听，”小王子说：“我们唤醒了这口井，它现在唱起歌来了……”
I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there-- happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water.	我慢慢地把水桶提到井栏上。我把它稳稳地放在那里。我的耳朵里还响着辘轳的歌声。依然还在晃荡的水面上，我看见太阳的影子在跳动。
"I am thirsty for this water," said the little prince. "Give me some of it to drink…"	“我正需要喝这种水。”小王子说：“给我喝点……”
I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received.	我把水桶提到他的嘴边。他闭着眼睛喝水。就像节日一般舒适愉快。这水远不只是一种饮料，它是披星戴月走了许多路才找到的，是在辘轳的歌声中，经过我双臂的努力得来的。它像是一件礼品慰藉着心田。在我小的时候，圣诞树的灯光，午夜的弥撒的音乐，甜蜜的微笑，这一切都使圣诞节时我收到的礼品辉映着幸福的光彩。
"The men where you live," said the little prince, "raise five thousand roses in the same garden-- and they do not find in it what they are looking for."	“你这里的人在同一个花园中种植着五千朵玫瑰。”小王子说：“可是，他们却不能从中找到自己所要寻找的东西……”
"And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water."	“然而，他们所寻找的东西却是可以从一朵玫瑰花或一点儿水中找到的……”
"But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart…"	“眼睛是什么也看不见的。应该用心去寻找。”
I had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand is the color of honey. And that honey color was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense of grief?	我喝了水。我痛快地呼吸着空气。沙漠在晨曦中泛出蜂蜜的光泽。这蜂蜜般的光泽也使我感到幸福。为什么我要难过……
"You must keep your promise," said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.	小王子又重新在我的身边坐下。他温柔地对我说：“你应该实践你的诺言。”
"You know-- a muzzle for my sheep… I am responsible for this flower…"	“你知道……给我的小羊一个嘴套子……我要对我的花负责的呀！”
I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said:	我从口袋中拿出我的画稿。小王子瞅见了，笑着说：
"Your fox-- his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long."	“你画的狐狸……它那双耳朵……有点像犄角……而且又太长了！”
"You are not fair, little prince," I said. "I don't know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside."	“小家伙，你太不公正了。我过去只会画开着肚皮和闭着肚皮的巨蟒。”
"Oh, that will be all right," he said, "children understand."	“啊！这就行了。”他说：“孩子们认得出来。”
So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was torn.	我就用铅笔勾画了一个嘴套。当我把它递给小王子时，我心里很难受：
"You know-- my descent to the earth… Tomorrow will be its anniversary."	“你知道，我落在地球上……到明天就一周年了……”
And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, however, occurred to me:	我不知为什么，又感到一阵莫名其妙的心酸。这时，我产生了一个问题：
"Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you-- a week ago-- you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place where you landed?"	“一星期以前，我认识你的那天早上，你单独一个人在这旷无人烟的地方走着;这么说，这并不是偶然的了？你是要回到你降落的地方去是吗！”
The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions-- but when one flushes does that not mean "Yes"?	小王子脸又红了。他从来也不回答这些问题，但是，脸红，就等于说“是的”， 是吧？
"Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for you here. Come back tomorrow evening…"	“你现在该工作了。你应该回到你的机器那里去。我在这里等你。你明天晚上再来……”
But I was not reassured. I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed…	但是，我放心不下。我想起了狐狸的话。如果被人驯服了，就可能会要哭的……
Day after day the spider waited, head-down, for an idea to come to her. Hour by hour she sat motionless, deep in thought. Having promised Wilbur that she would save his life, she was determined to keep her promise.	为了想出一个主意，这只蜘蛛在网上倒悬了一天又一天。她就那么一连数小时静静地坐着，苦苦地思索。她已经对威伯许诺过要拯救他的生命，因此她决定实现自己的承诺。
Charlotte was naturally patient. She knew from experience that if she waited long enough, a fly would come to her web; and she felt sure that if she thought long enough about Wilbur’s problem, and idea would come to her mind.	夏洛天生就十分有耐心。以往的经验告诉她，如果耐心等待得够久，苍蝇会撞到她的网里来的；所以她知道如果对威伯的问题思考的时间足够久，一个好办法最终也会想出来的。
Finally, one morning toward the middle of July, the idea came. “Why, how perfectly simple!” she said to herself. “The way to save Wilbur’s life is to play a trick on Zuckerman. If I can fool a bug,” thought Charlotte, “I can surely fool a man. People are not as smart as bugs.”	将近七月中旬的一个早晨，好主意终于来了。“为什么没早想出来，这主意多简单呐！”她自语道。“拯救威伯的办法就是对祖克曼玩一个把戏。如果我能骗一只小虫子上当，”夏洛想，“我一定也能愚弄一个人。人类未必像虫子一样聪明。”
“I was just thinking,” said the spider, “that people are very gullible.”	“我正在想，”这只蜘蛛说，“人类是很容易上当的。”
“That’s a mercy,” replied Wilbur, and he lay down in the shade of his fence and went fast asleep. The spider, however, stayed wide awake, gazing affectionately at him and making plans for his future. Summer was half gone. She knew she didn’t have much time.	“那可太好了，”威伯回答着躺进栅栏的阴影里，很快就入睡了。这只蜘蛛仍然很清醒地呆在那里，深情地望着她的朋友，正在为他的将来做打算。夏天已经过去一半了。她知道她没有太多的时间了。
That morning, just as Wilbur fell asleep, Avery Arable wandered into the Zuckerman’s front yard, followed by Fern. Avery carried a live frog in his hand. Fern had a crown of daisies in her hair. The children ran for the kitchen.	那天早上，就在威伯仍在熟睡时，埃弗里·阿拉贝尔溜达到了祖克曼先生的前院，身后跟着芬。埃弗里手里抓着一只活青蛙。芬的头上戴着一顶金灿灿的雏菊花冠。两个孩子跑进了厨房。
“Just in time for a piece of blueberry pie,” said Mrs. Zuckerman.	“马上就可以吃浆果馅饼了，”祖克曼太太说。
“Look at my frog!” said Avery, placing the frog on the drainboard and holding out his hand for pie.	“看我的青蛙！”埃弗里说着把青蛙放到了水槽里，然后伸出手去要馅饼。
“He is not,” said Avery. “He lets me scratch him between the eyes.” The frog jumped and landed in Mrs. Zuckerman’s dishpan full of soapy water.	“他没死，”埃弗里说。“他只是两眼中间那里被我抓伤了。”青蛙跳进祖克曼太太那满是肥皂沫的洗碗桶里。
“You’re getting your pie on you,” said Fern. “Can I look for eggs in the henhouse, Aunt Edith?”	“你在这等着吃你的馅饼吧，”芬说。“我能去找找鸡窝里的蛋吗，伊迪丝舅妈？”
“It’s getting all over everything,” shouted Fern. “His pie is all over his front.”	“水溅得到处都是，”芬大喊。“他面前的馅饼上都是水！”
“Come on, frog!” cried Avery. He scooped up his frog. The fog kicked, splashing soapy water onto the blueberry pie.	“过来，青蛙！”埃弗里叫着，去水中捞他的青蛙。青蛙又踢又蹬，把肥皂水溅到浆果馅饼上面。
Mr. Zuckerman had the best swing in the county. It was a single long piece of heavy rope tied to the beam over the north doorway. At the bottom end of the rope was a fat knot to sit on. It was arranged so that you could swing without being pushed. You climbed a ladder to the hayloft. Then, holding the rope, you stood at the edge and looked down, and were scared and dizzy. Then you straddled the knot, so that it acted as a seat. Then you got up all your nerve, took a deep breath, and jumped. For a second you seemed to be falling to the barn floor far below, but then suddenly the rope would begin to catch you, and you would sail through the barn door going a mile a minute, with the wind whistling in your eyes and ears and hair. Then you would zoom upward into the sky, and look up at the clouds, and the rope would twist and you would twist and turn with the rope. Then you would drop down, down, down out of the sky and come sailing back into the barn almost into the hayloft, then sail out again (not quite so far this time), then in again (not quite so high), then out again, then in again, then out, then in; and then you’d jump off and fall down and let somebody else try it.	祖克曼先生有一个村子里最棒的秋千。它是一根一端系在谷仓北门房粱上的粗壮的长绳子。绳子的末端有一个可以坐上去的宽宽的绳结。这种秋千不必靠别人推就能荡起来。你先从上面的梯子下爬到放干草的地方，再握住绳子站在那上面，这时如果往下看你可能会感到害怕和头晕。接着，你叉起腿坐在绳结上，就像坐在座位里一样。然后你就鼓起你所有的勇气，做一个深呼吸，开始往上荡。在一秒钟之内你还觉得自己好像就要跌到谷仓下面的地上了，但猛然间那绳子却拉住了你，让你以每分钟一哩的速度由谷仓门那里往天空航行，呼呼的风声掠过你的眼睛，耳朵，头发。然后你将笔直地飞升进天空里，看见云彩。绳子会盘旋起来，你也会和它扭在一起，往天上飞。然后你会下落，下落，从天空回航到谷仓里来，几乎都扎进干草堆那里了。接着你又飞出去了（这次飞得就不那么远了），再次飞出去（也不会飞那么高了），再飞出去，再飞回来，去，回；这时你该从秋千上跳下来让别人玩了。
Mothers for miles around worried about Zuckerman’s swing. They feared some child would fall off. But no child ever did. Children almost always hang onto things tighter than their parents think they will.	附近的母亲们都为祖克曼先生的秋千担心。她们怕会有孩子从上面掉下来。但从没哪个孩子摔下来过。孩子们总是抓得比他们的父母所想象得还要牢。
Avery put the frog in his pocket and climbed to the hayloft. “The last time I swang in this swing, I almost crashed into a barn swallow,” he yelled.	埃弗里把青蛙装进兜里爬上了干草堆。“我上次在这荡秋千时，差点砰地一声撞到谷仓上的燕子呢。”他叫道。
Avery straddled the rope and jumped. He sailed out through the door, frog and all, and into the sky, frog and all. Then he sailed back into the barn.	埃弗里叉起腿坐到绳子上荡起来。他飞出门口时，兜里的青蛙和别的东西也一起飞上了天。接着，他又飞回了谷仓。
“So is yours!” cried Avery, sailing out again with the frog.	“你的也是！”埃弗里叫着，又和那只青蛙一起飞出去了。
When he jumped off, he threw the swing up to his sister. She shut her eyes tight and jumped. She felt the dizzy drop, then the supporting lift of the swing. When she opened her eyes she was looking up into the blue sky and was about to fly back through the door.	他跳下来，把秋千扔给了妹妹。她紧闭着眼荡了上去。她荡回来时感到有点头晕，可秋千又很快把她拉了上去。她睁开眼，在再次飞回到门口之前，看到了蓝蓝的天空。
When the children grew tired of swinging, they went down toward the pasture and picked wild raspberries and ate them. Their tongues turned from purple to red. Fern bit into a raspberry that had a bad-tasting bug inside it, and got discouraged. Avery found an empty candy box and put his frog in it. The frog seemed tired after his morning in the swing. The children walked slowly up toward the barn. They, too, were tired and hardly had energy enough to walk.	当孩子们荡累了，他们便去草场找覆盆子吃。他们的紫舌头都吃红了。芬在一个覆盆子里吃到了一个恶心的小虫子，才不敢再吃了。埃弗里找到一个空的糖果盒，便把青蛙装了进去。青蛙好像今早在秋千上玩累了。孩子们慢慢向谷仓晃去。他们已经累得几乎没有力气走了。
“Let’s build a tree house,” suggested Avery. “I want to live in a tree, with my frog.”	“让我们造一座树上的房子吧，”埃弗里建议。“我想住在树上，和我的青蛙在一起。”
They climbed the fence into the lane and walked lazily toward the pigpen. Wilbur heard them coming and got up.	他们爬过栅栏，进了院子，懒洋洋地往猪圈挪。听到他们的脚步声，威伯忙爬了起来。
Avery noticed the spider web, and, coming closer, he saw Charlotte.	埃弗里注意到了那张蜘蛛网，走上前去，就看见了夏洛。
“Hey, look at that big spider!” he said. “It’s tremendous.”	“嘿，看那只大蜘蛛！”他说。“它可真大呀。”
“Leave it alone!” commanded Fern. “You’ve got a frog—isn’t that enough?”	“别碰它！”芬命令。“你已经有了一只青蛙了——这还不够吗？”
“That’s a fine spider and I’m going to capture it,” said Avery. He took the cover off the candy box. Then he picked up a stick. “I’m going to knock that old spider into this box,” he said.	“那可是只不错的蜘蛛，我要抓到它，”埃弗里说。他掀开糖果盒的盖子，然后又拾起一根小棍子。“我要把那大蜘蛛打到这盒子里，”他说。
Wilbur’s heart almost stopped when he saw what was going on. This might be the end of Charlotte if the boy succeeded in catching her.	当看到他在做什么时，威伯的心跳几乎都停止了。如果这个男孩成功地抓住了她，夏洛就完了。
Avery put one leg over the fence of the pigpen. He was just about to raise his stick to hit Charlotte when he lost his balance. He swayed and toppled and landed on the edge of Wilbur’s trough. The trough tipped up and then came down with a slap. The goose egg was right underneath. There was a dull explosion as the egg broke, and then a horrible smell.	埃弗里一条腿迈上了栅栏旁的猪食槽。就在准备举起棍子捅夏洛时，他突然失去了平衡。他摇摇晃晃地倒栽在威伯的食槽边上。绑在那里的食槽啪地一声掉了下来，正好砸在那下面的鹅蛋上。蛋随着一声钝响爆炸了，立刻散发出一种极其可怕的气味。
Fern screamed. Avery jumped to his feet. The air was filled with the terrible gases and smells from the rotten egg. Templeton, who had been resting in his home, scuttled away into the barn.	芬尖叫。埃弗里跳起来。空气中全是这只臭蛋的可怕味道。正在家里休息的坦普尔曼急急躲进了谷仓。
“Good night!” screamed Avery. “Good night! What a stink! Let’s get out of here!”	“天哪！”埃弗里尖叫。“天哪！什么臭味儿！我们快离开这里吧！”
Fern was crying. She held her nose and ran toward the house. Avery ran after her, holding his nose. Charlotte felt greatly relieved to see him go. It had been a narrow escape.	芬叫着，捏着鼻子朝房子跑去。埃弗里也捏着鼻子紧随其后。看到他逃走了，夏洛才大大松了一口气。刚才真是死里逃生。
Later on that morning, the animals came up from the pasture—the sheep, the lambs, the gander, the goose, and the seven goslings. There were many complaints about the awful smell, and Wilbur had to tell the story over and over again, of how the Arable boy had tried to capture Charlotte, and how the smell of the broken egg drove him away just in time. “It was that rotten goose egg that saved charlotte’s life,” said Wilbur.	那天早上晚些时候，动物们都从草场那边走回来了——绵羊，羊羔，公鹅，母鹅，七只小鹅。他们对这可怕的气味发出很多抱怨，因此威伯不得不把这个阿拉贝尔家的男孩如何想要抓夏洛，而打碎的蛋又是怎么及时地把他赶跑的故事讲了一遍又一遍。“正是那只破鹅蛋救了夏洛一命，”威伯说。
The goose was proud of her share in the adventure. “I’m delighted that the egg never hatched,” she gabbled.	母鹅为这场历险中有自己的功劳而骄傲。“我很高兴那只蛋没孵出来，”她急急地说。
Templeton, of course, was miserable over the loss of his beloved egg. But he couldn’t resist boasting. “It pays to save things,” he said in his surly voice. “A rat never knows when something is going to come in handy. I never throw anything away.	当然，可怜的坦普尔曼可悲地损失了他收藏的蛋。可他却情不自禁在那里自夸起来。“这就是收藏的回报，”他以一种不容置疑的口气说，“一只老鼠从不知道何时会发生想不到的事情。因此我从不扔掉我的任何收藏。”
“Well,” said one of the lambs, “this whole business is all well and good for Charlotte, but what about the rest of us? The smell is unbearable. Who wants to live in a barn that is perfumed with rotten egg?”	“是呀，”一只羊羔说，“整件事情只对夏洛有好处，可对我们其余的人呢？这味儿真让人受不了。谁想住在全是臭蛋味儿的谷仓里？”
“Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it,” said Templeton. He sat up and pulled wisely at his long whiskers, then crept away to pay a visit to the dump.	“不必担心，你会习惯的，”坦普尔曼说。他坐起来，揪揪长胡子，然后到垃圾堆参观去了。
When Lurvy showed up at lunchtime carrying a pail of food for Wilbur, he stopped short a few paces from the pigpen. He sniffed the air and made a face.	中午时分，鲁维拎着给威伯的食桶走了过来，停到猪圈前。他抽抽鼻子作了个鬼脸。
“What in thunder?” he said. Setting the pail down, he picked up the stick that Avery had dropped and pried the trough up. “Rats!” he said. “Fhew! I might have known a rat would make a nest under this trough. How I hate a rat!”	“怎么了？”他说着，放下食桶，拎起埃弗里扔在那里的棍子把食槽侦察了一番。“老鼠！”他说，“对了！我早该猜到老鼠会在食槽下打洞的。我多恨老鼠！”
And Lurvy dragged Wilbur’s trough across the yard and kicked some dirt into the rat’s nest, burying the broken egg and all Templeton’s other possessions. Then he picked up the pail. Wilbur stood in the trough, drooling with hunger. Lurvy poured. The slops ran creamily down around the pig’s eyes and ears. Wilbur grunted. He gulped and sucked, making swishing and swooshing noises, anxious to get everything at once. It was a delicious meal—skim milk, wheat middlings, leftover pancakes, half a doughnut, the rind of a summer squash, two pieces of stale toast, a third of a gingersnap, a fish tail, one orange peel, several noodles from a noodle soup, the scum off a cup of cocoa, an ancient jelly roll, a strip of paper from the lining of the garbage pail, and a spoonful of raspberry jello.	鲁维把威伯的食槽拽到了院子中间后，往耗子洞踢进了一些脏土，将那只破蛋和坦普尔曼其他的收藏品一起盖上。然后他才拎起了食桶。在食槽边等候的威伯，馋得口水都流出来了。鲁维把饲料倒下去，残渣溅得威伯满眼满耳都是。威伯打着呼噜冲过来。他吞了又吸，吸了又吞，急急挥舞着鼻子，迫不及待地吞食着每一样东西。这顿饭丰盛极了——有脱脂奶，粗麦粉，薄煎饼渣，半张油煎圈饼，南瓜皮，两片烤面包，三分之一块的脆饼干，一条鱼尾巴，一块橙子皮，面条汤里捞出的几根面条，一杯残剩的可可，一个干硬的小圆面包，食桶上剥落的纸片，还有一匙覆盆子果冻。
Wilbur ate heartily. He planned to leave half a noodle and a few drops of milk for Templeton. Then he remembered that the rat had been useful in saving Charlotte’s life, and that Charlotte　was trying to save his life. So he left a whole noodle, instead of a half.	威伯吃了个痛快。他本打算给坦普尔曼留下半根面条和几滴牛奶，可是又一想老鼠也有救夏洛的功劳，而夏洛又在准备救自己，便给老鼠留了一整根儿的面条，而不是半根。
Now that the broken egg was buried, the air cleared and the barn smelled good again. The afternoon passed, and evening came. Shadows lengthened. The cool and kindly breath of evening entered through doors and windows. Astride her web, Charlotte sat moodily eating a horsefly and thinking about the future. After a while she bestirred herself.	现在那只破蛋已经被埋起来了，空气也清新起来，谷仓又恢复了原来的气味。下午过去了，夜晚来了。影子变长了。凉爽宜人的夜风从门和窗子透过来。蹲坐在网里的夏洛，正在心事重重地吃着一只马蝇，想着以后的事情。不久，她突然振奋起来。
She descended to the center of the web and there she began to cut some of her lines. She worked slowly but steadily while the other creatures drowsed. None of the others, not even the goose, noticed that she was at work. Deep in his soft bed, Wilbur snoozed. Over in their favorite corner, the goslings whistled a night song.	她降落到网的中央，开始把某些地方的丝拉断。她不断地，慢慢地工作着，而这时别的动物都在打瞌睡呢。所以没有一个人，甚至那只母鹅也没有注意到她在工作。深深躺在他的软床里的威伯，也正睡得呼呼的。在他们最喜欢呆的角落里，小鹅们正在哼着夜之歌。
Charlotte tore quite a section out of her web, leaving an open space in the middle. Then she started weaving something to take the place of the threads she had removed. When Templeton got back from the dump, around midnight, the spider was still at work.	夏洛已经把她的网撕开不少地方了，中间留出了很大的一块空间。然后她开始在那里重新织起来。当坦普尔曼从垃圾堆那里回来时，已是快半夜了，可蜘蛛还在工作着。
It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply.	这是我在沙漠上出了事故的第八天。我听着有关这个商人的故事，喝完了我所备用的最后一滴水。
"Ah," I said to the little prince, "these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!"	“啊！”我对小王子说，“你回忆的这些故事真美。可是，我还没有修好我的飞机。我没有喝的了，假如我能悠哉游哉地走到泉水边去，我一定也会很高兴的！”
"It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend..."	“即使快要死了，有过一个朋友也好么！我就为我有过一个狐狸朋友而感到很高兴……”
"He has no way of guessing the danger," I said to myself. "He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs..."	“他不顾危险。”我自己思量着，“他从来不知道饥渴。只要有点阳光，他就满足了……”
I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking.	我显出厌烦的样子：在茫茫的大沙漠上盲目地去找水井，真荒唐。然而我们还是开始去寻找了。
When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream.	当我们默默地走了好几个小时以后，天黑了下来，星星开始发出光亮。由于渴我有点发烧，我看着这些星星，像是在做梦一样。
I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him.	我不懂他的话是什么意思，可我也不做声……我知道不应该去问他。
He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:	他累了，他坐下来。我在他身旁坐下。沉默了一会，他又说道：
"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen."	“星星是很美的，因为有一朵人们看不到的花……”
I replied, "Yes, that is so." And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight.	我回答道：“当然。”而我默默地看着月光下沙漠的褶皱。
And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams...	确实如此。我一直很喜欢沙漠。坐在一个沙丘上，什么也看不见、听不见。但是，却有一种说不出的东西在默默地放着光芒……
"What makes the desert beautiful," said the little prince, "is that somewhere it hides a well..."	“使沙漠更加美丽的，就是在某个角落里，藏着一口井……”
I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart...	我很惊讶，突然明白了为什么沙漠放着光芒。当我还是一个小孩子的时候，我住在一座古老的房子里，而且传说，这个房子里埋藏着一个宝贝。当然，从来没有任何人能发现这个宝贝，可能，甚至也没有人去寻找过。但是，这个宝贝使整个房子着了魔似的。我家的房子在它的心灵深处隐藏着一个秘密……
"Yes," I said to the little prince. "The house, the stars, the desert-- what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!"	我对小王子说道：“是的，无论是房子，星星，或是沙漠，使它们美丽的东西是看不见的！”
"I am glad," he said, "that you agree with my fox."	“我真高兴，你和我的狐狸的看法一样。”小王子说。
As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."	小王子睡觉了，我就把他抱在怀里，又重新上路了。我很激动。就好像抱着一个脆弱的宝贝。就好像在地球上没有比这更脆弱的了。我借着月光看着这惨白的面额，这双紧闭的眼睛，这随风飘动的绺绺头发，这时我对自己说道：“我所看到的仅仅是外表。最重要的是看不见的……”
As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower-- the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..." And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...	由于看到他稍稍张开的嘴唇露出一丝微笑，我又自言自语地说：“在这个熟睡了的小王子身上，使我非常感动的，是他对他那朵花的忠诚，是在他心中闪烁的那朵玫瑰花的形象。这朵玫瑰花，即使在小王子睡着了的时候，也像一盏灯的火焰一样在他身上闪耀着光辉……”这时，我就感觉到他更加脆弱。应该保护灯焰：一阵风就可能把它吹灭……
Twilight settled over Zuckerman's barn, and a feeling of peace.	薄暮的余晖把祖克曼先生的谷仓笼罩在宁静、平和的气氛里。
Fern knew it was almost suppertime but she couldn't bear to leave.	芬知道差不多到晚饭时间了，却还是舍不得离去。
Swallows passed on silent wings, in and out of the doorways, bringing food to their young ones. From across the road a bird sang“Whippoorwill, whippoorwill!” Lurvy sat down under an apple tree and lit his pipe; the animals sniffed the familiar smell of strong tobacco. Wilbur heard the trill of the tree toad and the occasional slamming of the kitchen door. All these sounds made him feel comfortable and happy, for he loved life and loved to be a part of the world on a summer evening. But as he lay there he remembered what the old sheep had told him. The thought of death came to him and he began to tremble with fear.	燕子无声地拍着翅膀，从门口飞进飞出，一遍遍的给他们的孩子衔来食物。小路那边有一只夜鸱在唱：“威普威噢，威普威噢！”鲁维坐在一棵苹果树下，吸着他的烟斗；动物们都闻到了那种熟悉的刺鼻的烟草味儿。威伯听到了树蟾的颤音和不时传来的开关厨房门的声音。所有的这些声音都让他感觉惬意而又幸福，因为他热爱生活，愿意成为这夏夜世界的一分子。但是，当他躺在那里时，他忽然记起了老羊告诉过他的话。他开始想到了死，就害怕得哆嗦起来。
“I just love it here in the barn,” said Wilbur. “I love everything about this place.”	“我爱谷仓。”威伯说。“我爱这里的一切。”
The goose appeared, followed by her seven goslings. They thrust their little necks out and kept up a musical whistling, like a tiny troupe of pipers. Wilbur listened to the sound with love in his heart.	母鹅出现了，身后跟着她的七只小鹅。他们歪着他们的小脖子，哼着同样的旋律，就像一小队吹笛手。威伯满是爱意地听着这种声音。
“Were you serious when you promised you would keep them from killing me?”	“你曾承诺过不让他们杀我，你是认真的吗？”
“I was never more serious in my life. I am not going to let you die, Wilbur.”	“在我一生中还从没这么认真过呢。我不会让你死的，威伯。”
“How are you going to save me?” asked Wilbur, whose curiosity was very strong on this point.	“你打算怎么救我呢？”强烈想知道这点的威伯问。
“Well,” said Charlotte, vaguely, “I don't really know. But I'm working on a plan.”	“唔，”夏洛含混地说，“我还不知道呢。但是我正在制订计划。”
“That's wonderful,” said Wilbur. “How is the plan coming, Charlotte? Have you got very far with it? Is it coming along pretty well?” Wilbur was trembling again, but Charlotte was cool and collected.	“好极了，”威伯说，“这计划的开始是怎么样的，夏洛？你已经想出很多步骤了吗？它进展得非常顺利吗？”威伯又打了一个冷战，可夏洛还是非常冷静。
“Oh, it's coming all right,” she said, lightly. “The plan is still in its early stages and hasn't completely shaped up yet, but I'm working on it.	“哦，计划就快弄好了，”她轻声地说，“这计划还刚刚开头，没有成形，不过我会弄好的。”
“When I'm hanging head-down at the top of my web. That’s when I do my thinking, because then all the blood is in my head.”	“在我倒挂在我的网上的时候吧。那时我才能想事情，因为那时全身的血才会涌到我的脑袋里。”
“Oh, I'll work it out alone,” said Charlotte. “I can think better if I think alone.”	“哦，我将一个人解决它，”夏洛说，“我一个人时会想出更好的办法。”
“All right,” said Wilbur. “But don't fail to let me know if there's anything I can do to help, no matter how slight.	“好吧，”威伯说，“但是如果有什么我能做的，不管是多么小的事儿，你也别忘了告诉我。”
“Well,” replied Charlotte, “you must try to build yourself up. I want you to get plenty of sleep, and stop worrying. Never hurry and never worry! Chew your food thoroughly and eat every bit of it, except you must leave just enough for Templeton. Gain weight and stay well — that’s the way you can help. Keep fit, and don’tlose your nerve. Do you think you understand?	“好的，”夏洛回答，“你必需加强你的信心。我要你保持充足的睡眠，不要再担忧了。永远也不要着急和担心！慢慢地吃光你的每一点食物，除了你剩给坦普尔曼的那些。把自己吃胖，好好活着——这就是你能帮我做的。保持健康，不要气馁。你明白了吗？”
“Go along to bed, then,” said Charlotte. “Sleep is important.”	“那么上床休息吧，”夏洛说，“睡眠是很重要的。”
Wilbur trotted over to the darkest corner of his pen and threw himself down. He closed his eyes. In another minute he spoke.	威伯迅速地跑到猪圈里最黑的角落，躺了下来。他闭上了眼睛。几分钟后他又说开了。
“May I go out to my trough and see if I left any of my supper? I think I left just a tiny bit of mashed potato.” 	“我可以到食槽去看看是否还有剩下的晚餐吗？我想我还剩了点儿土豆泥。”
“Very well,” said Charlotte. “But I want you in bed again without delay.”	“可以，”夏洛说，“不过吃完你得立刻回来睡觉。”
“Slowly, slowly!” said Charlotte. “Never hurry and never worry!”	“慢点儿，慢点儿！”夏洛说。“永远不要着急和担心！”
Wilbur checked himself and crept slowly to his trough. He found a bit of potato, chewed it carefully, swallowed it, and walked back to bed. He closed his eyes and was silent for a while.	威伯硬生生的放慢了脚步，开始缓缓地往食槽爬。他找到一小块土豆，便细细地咀嚼，咽下，然后才回到了床上。他闭上眼，沉默了一小会儿。
“May I get a drink of milk? I think there are a few drops of milk left in my trough.”	“我可以喝点儿牛奶吗？我想我的食槽里还剩几滴牛奶呢。”
“No, the trough is dry, and I want you to go to sleep. No more talking! Close your eyes and go to sleep!”	“不，食槽已经空了，我要你马上睡觉。不许再讲话！闭上眼睡觉！”
Wilbur shut his eyes. Fern got up from her stool and started for home, her mind full of everything she had seen and heard.	威伯闭上了眼。芬从她的小凳上站起来，开始往家走，她看见、听到的每一件事都装到了脑子里。
A spider's web is stronger than it looks. Although it is made of thin, delicate strands, the web is not easily broken. However, a web gets torn every day by the insects that kick around in it, and a spider must rebuild it when it gets full of holes. Charlotte liked to do her weaving during the late afternoon, and Fern liked to sit nearby and watch. One afternoon she heard a most interesting conversation and witnessed a strange event.	一张蜘蛛网实质上要比它看上去的样子要结实。虽然它是用精细的丝线织成的，但却不太容易被弄破。可是，一个蜘蛛网每天都要被那些昆虫又撞又踢，所以里面还是会出现残破的地方。如果里面的破洞太多了，蜘蛛就得重新把网织好才行。夏洛喜欢在傍晚织网，芬也喜欢坐在旁边看她织。一天下午，芬听到了一场最有趣的谈话，并目睹了一起奇怪的事件。
“You have awfully hairy legs, Charlotte,” said Wilbur, as the spider busily worked at her task.	“你长着可怕而又多毛的长腿，夏洛，”当夏洛正在忙着她的工作时，威伯说。
“My legs are hairy for a good reason,” replied Charlotte. “Furthermore, each leg of mine has seven sections—the coxa, the trochanter, the femur, the patella, the tibia, the metatarsus, and the tarsus.”	“我的腿上有毛，是有原因的，”夏洛回答。“此外，我的每条腿都由七节骨头构成——髋骨，坐骨，大腿骨，膝盖骨，胫骨，跗骨，蹠骨。”
“Coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, metatarsus, and tarsus.”	“髋骨，坐骨，大腿骨，膝盖骨，胫骨，跗骨，蹠骨。”
“Goodness!” said Wilbur, looking down at his own chubby legs. “I don't think my legs have seven sections.”	“天哪！”威伯说着，往下看看自己的胖腿。“我不信我的腿上有七根骨头。”
“Well,” said Charlotte, “you and I lead different lives. You don't have to spin a web. That takes real leg work.”	“哦，”夏洛说，“你和我的生活方式不同。你不用织网，那可全是用腿干的活儿。”
“I could spin a web if I tried,” said Wilbur, boasting. “I've just never tried.”	“如果我学学，也能会织网，”威伯吹嘘道。“我只是从没试过而已。”
“O.K.,” replied Wilbur. “You coach me and I'll spin one. It must be a lot of fun to spin a web. How do I start?”	“好的。”威伯回答。“你教我织一张网吧。织网一定是特别好玩的。我先要怎么开始呢？”
“Take a deep breath!” said Charlotte, smiling. Wilbur breathed deeply.	“深呼吸！”夏洛微笑着说。威伯深吸了一口气。
“Now climb to the highest place you can get to, like this.”	“现在爬到你能到的最高地方去，就像这样。”
Charlotte raced up to the top of the doorway. Wilbur scrambled to the top of the manure pile.	夏洛跑到了门框的最上端。威伯爬到了牛粪堆的最上面。
“Very good!” said Charlotte. “Now make an attachment with your spinnerets, hurl yourself into space, and let out a dragline as you go down!” 	“很好！”夏洛说，“现在用你的丝囊造丝把自己用力抛向空中，下落时把丝线抽出来！”
Wilbur hesitated a moment, then jumped out into the air. He glanced hastily behind to see if a piece of rope was following him to check his fall, but nothing seemed to be happening in his rear, and the next thing he knew he landed with a thump. “Ooomp!” he grunted.	威伯犹豫了一下，然后朝空中跳去。他扭身回望，看后面是否有一小根能阻止他下落的粘线，可却发现后部似乎什么变化都没有，接着他便听到了自己重重地撞在地上的声音。“嗷姆！”他咕噜着抱怨道。
“What did I do wrong?” asked the pig, when he recovered from his bump.	“我哪一步做错了？”清醒过来以后，威伯问道。
“I think I'll try again,” said Wilbur, cheerfully. “I believe what I need is a little piece of string to hold me.”	“我想我该再试一次。”威伯又来劲儿了。“我相信这一次我只需要一段能拴住我的绳子就够了。”
The pig walked out to his yard. “You there, Templeton?” he called. The rat poked his head out from under the trough.	威伯走到院子里。“你在吗，坦普尔曼？”他喊道。老鼠从食槽下探出了头。
“Got a little piece of string I could borrow?” asked Wilbur. “I need it to spin a web.”	“我能向你借一小根绳子吗？”威伯请求。”我要用它来织网。”
“Yes, indeed,” replied Templeton, who saved string. “No trouble at all. Any thing to oblige.” He crept down into his hole, pushed the goose egg out of the way, and returned with an old piece of dirty white string. Wilbur examined it.	“好的，可以。”有绳子的坦普尔曼回答。“这事儿很容易，你不必客气。”他推开洞口的那只鹅蛋，钻进了洞里，一会儿就抓着一根脏旧的白绳子出来了。威伯检查了一下。
“That's just the thing,” he said. “Tie one end to my tail, will you, Templeton?”	“就是这东西，”他说。“坦普尔曼，请你把绳子的一头系到我的尾巴上，好吗？”
Wilbur crouched low, with his thin, curly tail toward the rat. Templeton seized the string, passed it around the end of the pig's tail, and tied two half hitches. Charlotte watched in delight. Like Fern, she was truly fond of Wilbur, whose smelly pen and stale food attracted the flies that she needed, and she was proud to see thathe was not a quitter and was willing to try again to spin a web.	威伯趴下来，把他那根又细又弯的尾巴朝向老鼠那边。坦普尔曼抓住绳子，把它绕到威伯的尾巴尖上，打了两个结。夏洛开心地看着这一切。像芬一样，她也是真心的喜欢威伯，这不只是因为他那肮脏的猪圈与尿的臭味儿能招来她需要的苍蝇，还因为她骄傲地看出他不是一个懦夫，勇于一再的学习织网。
While the rat and the spider and the little girl watched, Wilbur climbed again to the top of the manure pile, full of energy and hope.	就在老鼠，蜘蛛和小女孩的注视下，威伯又满怀着活力与希望爬到牛粪堆的顶上。
“Everybody watch!” he cried. And summoning all his strength, he threw himself into the air, headfirst. The string trailed behind him. But as he had neglected to fasten the other end to anything, it didn't really do any good, and Wilbur landed with a thud, crushed and hurt. Tears came to his eyes. Templeton grinned. Charlotte just sat quietly. After a bit she spoke.	“大家看着！”他叫着，拼着全身的力气，头朝前往空中跳去。绳子虽然系在他身后，但是他忘了把另一头拴到什么地方了，这可真糟糕，威伯砰的一声就着了陆，把自己跌伤了。泪水开始在他的眼眶打转了。坦普尔曼呲着牙大笑起来。夏洛沉默了片刻，才开始说话。
“You can't spin a web, Wilbur, and I advise you to put the idea out of your mind. You lack two things needed for spinning aweb.”	“你不能织网，威伯，我劝你把这念头从脑子里赶出去吧。你缺少织网所必需的两种东西。”
“You lack a set of spinnerets, and you lack know-how. But cheer up, you don't need a web. Zucherman supplies you with three big meals a day. Why should you worry about trapping food?”	“你缺少一副丝囊，你也缺乏织网的技巧。但是振作些，你不需要织网，反正祖克曼先生每天都给你提供三顿大餐。你又何必为捕食的事情操心？”
Wilbur sighed. “You're ever so much cleverer and brighter thanI am, Charlotte. I guess I was just trying to show off. Serves me right.”	威伯悲叹。“你比我要聪明伶俐得多，夏洛。可我也想显一显我的能耐。我这是活该。”
Templeton untied his string and took it back to his home. Charlotte returned to her weaving.	坦普尔曼把他的绳子解下来，带回了他的家。夏洛又继续她的织网工作了。
“You needn't feel too badly, Wilbur,” she said. “Not many creatures can spin webs. Even men aren't as good at it as spiders, although they think they're pretty good, and they'll try anything. Did you ever hear of the Queensborough Bridge?”	“你不必太难过，威伯，”她说。“不是所有的动物都会织网的。即使人类也不能织得像蜘蛛一样好，虽然他们自认很优秀，可以学会任何事情。你听说过昆斯伯勒大桥吗？”
“Sort of,” replied Charlotte. “But do you know how long it took men to build it? Eight whole years. My goodness, I would have starved to death waiting that long. I can make a web in a single evening.”	“有点儿像吧，”夏洛回答。“你知道人们用了多久才建成它的吗？整整八年。我的老天，如果我的网等那么久才能织成，我早饿死了。我只用一个晚上就能织出一张网。”
“What do people catch in the Queensborough Bridge—bug?” asked Wilbur.	“人们在昆斯伯勒大桥上抓什么——虫子吗？”威伯问。
“No,” said Charlotte. “They don't catch anything. They just keep trotting back and forth across the bridge thinking there is something better on the other side. If they'd hang head-down at the top of the thing and wait quietly, maybe something good would comealong. But no—with men it's rush, rush, rush, every minute. I'm glad I'm a sedentary spider.”	“不，”夏洛说。“他们什么也不抓。他们只是觉得那上面比别的地方更好，所以就不停地在上面来回疾驰。如果他们头朝下静静地挂在桥上等着，也许会等来一些好东西吧。可他们却不这么做——人们总是在桥上狂奔，狂奔，狂奔，每分钟都是如此。我很高兴我只是一只定居的蜘蛛。”
“Means I sit still a good part of the time and don't go wandering all over creation. I know a good thing when I see it, and my web is a good thing. I stay put and wait for what comes. Gives me a chance to think.”	“就是说，我大部分时间都可以静静地呆着，不必满世界乱跑。当我一眼望去，就会发现什么是好东西，我的网就是一个好东西。因为在织网或等待什么东西飞来时，我总有我充分思考的机会。”
“Well, I'm sort of sedentary myself, I guess,” said the pig. “I have to hang around here whether I want to or not. You know where I'd really like to be this evening?”	“哦，那么我也是一种定居的动物，我猜，”威伯说。“因为不管喜不喜欢我都得呆在这儿。你知道今天晚上我最想去哪里吗？”
“In a forest looking for beechnuts and truffles and delectable roots, pushing leaves aside with my wonderful strong nose, searching and sniffing along the ground, smelling, smelling, smelling…”	“我想去大森林里寻找柏子，麦蕈，还有令我开心的树根，用我那奇妙而又强壮的鼻子把腐叶都清走，沿着地面搜索，吸取，闻呀，闻呀，闻呀……"
“You smell just the way you are,” remarked a lamb who had just walked in. I can smell you from here. You're the smelliest creature in the place.”	“好像你正在森林里闻似的，”刚走进来的羊羔挖苦道，“我从这里就能闻到你的味儿。你是这地方最臭的动物。”
Wilbur hung his head. His eyes grew wet with tears. Charlotte noticed his embarrassment and she spoke sharply to the lamb.	威伯伤心地垂下了头。他的眼睛被泪水打湿了。看到他难过的样子，夏洛毫不客气地讥讽起羊羔来。
“Leave Wilbur alone!” she said. “he has a perfect right to smell, considering his surroundings. You're no bundle of sweet peas yourself. Furthermore, you are interrupting a very pleasant conversation. What were we talking about, Wilbur, when we were so rudely interrupted?”	“用不着你管威伯！”她说。“生活在这种环境里，他已经算是很干净的了。你自己也不是什么甜豌豆。此外，你正在打搅我们之间的愉快谈话。我们谈到哪儿了，威伯，在我们的谈话被无礼打断之前？”
“Oh, I don't remember,” said Wilbur. “It doesn't make any difference. Let's not talk any more for a while, Charlotte. I'm getting sleepy. You go ahead and finish fixing your web and I'll just lie here and watch you. It's a lovely evening.” Wilbur stretched out on his side.	“噢，我不记得了，”威伯说。“这没什么关系。我们别再谈下去了，夏洛。我有点儿困了。你还是继续把你的网修补完吧，我就躺在这儿看你织。这是一个多么可爱的夜晚。”威伯伸了个懒腰躺下了。
This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink.	这是一位贩卖能够止渴的精制药丸的商人。每周吞服一丸就不会感觉口渴。
"Because they save a tremendous amount of time," said the merchant. "Computations have been made by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week."	“这就大大地节约了时间。”商人说，“专家们计算过，这样，每周可以节约五十三分钟。”
"As for me," said the little prince to himself, "if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water."	小王子自言自语地说：“我如果有五十三分钟可支配，我就悠哉游哉地向泉水走去……”
On Sunday morning Mr. and Mrs. Arable and Fern were sitting at breakfast in the kitchen. Avery had finished and was upstairs looking for his slingshot.	星期六早上，阿拉贝尔先生和太太还有芬正坐在厨房吃早餐。埃弗里已经吃过了饭，便上楼找他的弹弓去了。
"Did you know that Uncle Homer's goslings had hatched?" asked Fern.	“你们知道霍默舅舅的小鹅孵出来了吗？”芬问。
"Seven," replied Fern. "There were eight eggs but one egg didn't hatch and the goose told Templeton she didn't want it any more, so he took it away."	“七个。”芬回答。“本来有八个蛋，但有一个没孵出来。母鹅告诉坦普尔曼她不想要这个蛋了，所以他把蛋带走了。”
"The goose did what?" asked Mrs. Arable, gazing at her daughter with a queer, worried look.	“母鹅说什么了？”阿拉贝尔太太惊奇而又担心地盯着女儿问。
"Told Templeton she didn't want the egg any more," repeated Fern.	“她告诉坦普尔曼，她不想再要那个蛋了，”芬重复道。
"He's the rat," replied Fern. "None of us like him much."	“他就是那只老鼠，”芬回答。“我们都不太喜欢他。”
"Oh, everybody in the barn cellar. Wilbur and the sheep and the lambs and the goose and the gander and the goslings and Charlotte and me."	“噢，就是住在谷仓地窖里的所有人。威伯，绵羊，羊羔，母鹅，公鹅，小鹅，夏洛和我。”
"Well-l," said Fern, thoughtfully, "she has eight legs. All spiders do, I guess."	“嗯，”芬仔细想了想，说，“她有八条腿。所有的蜘蛛都如此，我猜。”
Fern nodded. "A big grey one. She has a web across the top of Wilbur's doorway. She catches flies and sucks their blood. Wilbur adores her."	芬点点头：“一只很大的灰蜘蛛。她在威伯的门口上方织了一张网。她能抓苍蝇，还吸他们的血。威伯可崇拜她了。”
"Does he really?" said Mrs. Arable, rather vaguely. She was staring at Fern with a worried expression on her face.	“他真的崇拜她？”阿拉贝尔太太几乎听糊涂了。她用一种担忧的表情盯着芬的脸。
"Oh, yes, Wilbur adores Charlotte," said Fern. "Do you know what Charlotte said when the goslings hatched?"	“噢，是的，威伯崇拜夏洛。”芬说，“你知道当小鹅出世时夏洛说什么了？”
"I haven't the faintest idea," said Mr. Arable. "Tell us."	“我可什么都不知道，”阿拉贝尔先生说，“跟我们讲讲。”
"Well, when the first gosling stuck its little head out from under the goose, I was sitting on my stool in the corner and Charlotte was on her web. She made a speech. She said: 'I am sure that every one of us here in the barn cellar will be gratified to learn that after four weeks of unremitting effort and patience on the part of the goose, she now has something to show for it.' Don't you think that was a pleasant thing for her to say?"	“好吧。当第一只小鹅从鹅妈妈的身下伸出他的小脑袋时，我正在旁边的凳子上坐着，夏洛就在她的网上挂着。她发表了一场演说。她说：‘我们在谷仓地窖里的每一位都将高兴地获悉，经过四周的不懈努力与耐心的等待，我们的朋友母鹅终于取得了骄人的成绩。’你不认为她说的是件大喜事吗？”
"Yes, I do," said Mrs. Arable. "And now, Fern, it's time to get ready for Sunday School And tell Avery to get ready. And this afternoon you can tell me more about what goes on in Uncle Homer's barn. Aren't you spending quite a lot of time there? You go there almost every afternoon, don't you?"	“是的，我承认，”阿拉贝尔太太说。“现在，芬，该到上主日学校的时间了。告诉埃弗里做好准备。今天下午你可以把你霍默舅舅谷仓里的事儿再告诉我们一些。你在那里花了不少时间吧？你几乎每天下午都去，是不是？”
"I like it there," replied Fern. She wiped her mouth and ran upstairs. After she had left the room, Mrs. Arable spoke in a low voice to her husband.	“我喜欢那儿，”芬回答。她擦擦嘴巴跑上了楼。她离开房间后，阿拉贝尔太太和她丈夫低声交谈起来。
"I worry about Fern," she said. "Did you hear the way she rambled on about the animals, pretending that they talked?"	“我为芬担心，”她说，“你听见她是怎么信口开河地说那些动物的吗，好像他们会说话一样？”
Mr. Arable chuckled. "Maybe they do talk," he said. "I've sometimes wondered. At any rate, don't worry about Fern--she's just got a lively imagination. Kids think they hear all sorts of things."	阿拉贝尔先生微笑了。“可能他们真会说话吧，”他说，“我有时也觉得这很奇怪。不管怎样，不必担心芬——她不过是有生动的想象力罢了。小孩子认为他们什么都能听到。”
"Just the same, I do worry about her," replied Mrs. Arable. "I think I shall ask Dr. Dorian about her the next time I see him. He loves Fern almost as much as we do, and I want him to know how queerly she is acting about that pig and everything. I don't think it's normal. You know perfectly well animals don't talk."	“虽然如此，我还是担心她，”阿拉贝尔太太回答。“我想我下次看到多里安医生时，该对他谈谈芬的事儿。他几乎像我们一样的爱芬，我要问问他，芬自以为能听懂猪和别的动物的谈话，这是不是很奇怪。我不认为这是正常的。你完全知道动物们根本不会说话的。”
Mr. Arable grinned. "Maybe our ears aren't as sharp as Fern's," he said.	阿拉贝尔先生咧开嘴笑起来。“可能我们的耳朵不像芬那么尖吧，”他说。
"I sort out travelers, in bundles of a thousand," said the switchman. "I send off the trains that carry them; now to the right, now to the left."	“我一包包地分选旅客，按每千人一包。”扳道工说，“我打发这些运载旅客的列车，一会儿发往右方，一会儿发往左方。”
And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman's cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder.	这时，一列灯火明亮的快车，雷鸣般地响着，把扳道房震得颤颤悠悠。
"They are in a great hurry," said the little prince. "What are they looking for?"	“他们真匆忙呀，”小王子说，“他们要寻找什么？”
And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction.	于是，第二列灯火通明的快车又朝着相反的方向轰隆轰隆地开过去。
"No one is ever satisfied where he is," said the switchman.	“人们是从来也不会满意自己所在的地方的。”扳道工说。
"Are they pursuing the first travelers?" demanded the little prince.	“他们是在追随第一批旅客吗？”小王子问道。
"They are pursuing nothing at all," said the switchman. "They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes."	“他们什么也不追随。”扳道工说，“他们在里面睡觉，或是在打哈欠。只有孩子们把鼻子贴在玻璃窗上往外看。”
"Only the children know what they are looking for," said the little prince. "They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry..."	“只有孩子知道他们自己在寻找什么。”小王子说，“他们为一个布娃娃花费不少时间，这个布娃娃就成了很重要的东西，如果有人夺走他们的布娃娃，他们就哭泣……”
Wilbur liked Charlotte better and better each day. Her campaign against insects seemed sensible and useful. Hardly anybody around the farm had a good word to say for a fly. Flies spent their time pestering others. The cows hated them. The horses detested them. The sheep loathed them. Mr. and Mrs. Zukerman were always complaining about them, and putting up screens.	威伯一天比一天更喜欢夏洛了。她对昆虫发动的战争似乎是英明的，有益处的。农场周围几乎没人为苍蝇说一句好话，因为苍蝇把他们的所有时间都用来骚扰别人了。母牛恨他们。马憎恶他们。绵羊讨厌他们。祖克曼先生和太太也总是抱怨他们，所以特意装上了纱窗。
Wilbur admired the way Charlotte managed. He was particularly glad that she always put her victim to sleep before eating it.	威伯也欣赏夏洛的行事方法。他很高兴她能在吃她的受害者之前先把他们弄睡。
"Yes," she replied in her sweet, musical voice, "I always give them an anaesthetic so they won't feel pain. It's a little service I throw in."	“是的，”她用甜甜的嗓音回答，“我总是先麻醉他们，这样他们就不会感到疼了。这是我的一项小小的免费服务。”
As the days went by, Wilbur grew and grew. He ate three big meals a day. He spent long hours lying on his side, half asleep, dreaming pleasant dreams. He enjoyed good health and he gained a lot of weight. One afternoon, when Fern was sitting on her stool, the oldest sheep walked into the barn, and stopped to pay a call on Wilbur. 	很多天过去了，威伯长了又长。他一天要吃三头猪的饭量了。他把时间都花在躺着，小睡，做美梦上了。他的身体非常健康，体重也增长了许多。一天下午，当芬正在她的凳子上坐着时，那只老羊走到谷仓来拜访威伯。
"Yes, I guess I am," replied Wilbur. "At my age it's a good idea to keep gaining."	“是的，我想是，”威伯回答。“在我这个年纪胖起来是好事儿。”
"Just the same, I don't envy you," said the old sheep. "You know why they're fattening you up, don't you?"	“虽然如此，可我却不嫉妒你，”老羊说。“你知道他们为什么要把你养这么胖吗？”
"Well, I don't like to spread bad news," said the sheep, "but they're fattening you up because they're going to kill you, that's why."	“呃，我不喜欢传播坏消息，”老羊说，“但我还是要告诉你，他们喂胖你，其实是为了将来杀你，这就是原因。”
"They're going to what?" screamed Wilbur. Fern grew rigid on her stool.	“他们将来要做什么？”威伯尖叫。坐在凳子上的芬也听呆了。
"Kill you. Turn you into smoked bacon and ham," continued the old sheep. "Almost all young pigs get murdered by the farmer as soon as the real cold weather sets in. There's regular conspiracy around here to kill you at Christmastime. Everybody is in the plog--Lurvy, Zuckerman, even John Arable."	“杀死你。把你做成腌肉和火腿。”老羊继续说。“几乎所有年青的小猪到了冬天来的时候都会被农场主谋杀。这里有个尽人皆知的阴谋，就是你将在圣诞节被杀掉。每个人都在参与这个计划——鲁维，祖克曼甚至约翰·阿拉贝尔。”
"Mr. Arable?" sobbed Wilbur. "Fern's father?"	“阿拉贝尔先生？”威伯啜泣起来。“芬的爸爸？”
"Certainly. When a pig is to be butchered, everybody helps. I'm an old sheep and I see the same thing, same old business, year after year. Arable arrives with hi.22, shoots the..."	“当然了。宰一头猪时，每人都要来帮忙的。我是一只老羊，这样的事儿见得多了，每一年都是这老一套。阿拉贝尔会带着他的0.22口径的枪，来射向……”
"Stop!" screamed Wilbur. "I don't want to die! Save me, somebody! Save me!" 	“别说了！”威伯尖叫。“我不想死！救我，来人哪！救我呀！”
"Be quiet, Wilbur!" said Charlotte, who had been listening to this awful conversation. 	“镇静，威伯！”一直听着这段恐怖对话的夏洛说。
"I can't be quiet," screamed Wilbur, racing up and down. "I don't want to be killed. I don't want to die. Is it true what the old sheep says, Charlotte? Is it true they are going to kill me when the cold weather comes?"	“我不能镇静，”威伯大嚷着跑来跑去。“我不想被杀死。我不想死。老羊说的是真的吗，夏洛？冬天来时他们真会杀我吗？”
"Well," said the spider, plucking thoughtfully at her web, "the old sheep has been around this barn a long time. She has seen many a spring pig come and go. If she says they plan to kill you, I'm sure it's true. It's also the dirtiest trick I ever heard of. What people don't think of!"	“唔，”夏洛说着，轻轻地拉了拉她的网，“老羊已经在这谷仓住很久了。她看过很多来去的春猪。如果她说人们打算杀你，我想那就是真的。这也是我听过的最可耻的诡计。人类有什么想不出来！”
Wilbur burst into tears. "I don't want to die," he moaned. "I want to stay alive, right here in my comfortable manure pile with all my friends. I want to breathe the beautiful air and lie in the beautiful sun."	威伯号啕大哭起来。“我不想死，”他呻吟。“我想在这里活着，就呆在我舒服的牛粪堆旁，和我所有的朋友在一起。我想呼吸甜美的空气，躺在美丽的太阳底下。”
"You're certainly making a beautiful noise," snapped the old sheep.	“你说的全是美丽的胡话。”老羊迅速地打断了他的话。
"What? Really?" cried Wilbur. "Who's going to save me?" 	“什么？真的吗？”威伯叫。“谁会来救我呢？”
"That remains to be seen. But I am going to save you, and I want you to quiet down immediately. You're carrying on in a childish way. Stop your crying! I can't stand hysterics."	“办法以后会有的。但是在我正考虑怎么救你的时候，我希望你立刻安静下来。你哭叫的样子简直像个小孩子。不要哭！我不能忍受歇斯底里。”
"Good morning," the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.	“你好。”小王子很有礼貌地回答道。他转过身来，但什么也没有看到。
"Come and play with me," proposed the little prince. "I am so unhappy."	“来和我一起玩吧，”小王子建议道，“我很苦恼……”
"I cannot play with you," the fox said. "I am not tamed."	“我不能和你一起玩，”狐狸说，“我还没有被驯服呢。”
"You do not live here," said the fox. "What is it that you are looking for?"	“你不是此地人。”狐狸说，“你来寻找什么？”
"I am looking for men," said the little prince. "What does that mean-- 'tame'?"	“我来找人。”小王子说，“什么叫‘驯服’呢？”
"Men," said the fox. "They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?"	“人，”狐狸说，“他们有枪，他们还打猎，这真碍事！他们唯一的可取之处就是他们也养鸡，你是来寻找鸡的吗？”
"No," said the little prince. "I am looking for friends. What does that mean-- 'tame'?"	“不，”小王子说，“我是来找朋友的。什么叫‘驯服’呢？”
"It is an act too often neglected," said the fox. It means to establish ties."	“这是已经早就被人遗忘了的事情，”狐狸说，“它的意思就是‘建立联系’。”
"Just that," said the fox. "To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world…"	“一点不错，”狐狸说。“对我来说，你还只是一个小男孩，就像其他千万个小男孩一样。我不需要你。你也同样用不着我。对你来说，我也不过是一只狐狸，和其他千万只狐狸一样。但是，如果你驯服了我，我们就互相不可缺少了。对我来说，你就是世界上唯一的了；我对你来说，也是世界上唯一的了。”
"I am beginning to understand," said the little prince. "There is a flower… I think that she has tamed me…"	“我有点明白了。”小王子说，“有一朵花……，我想，她把我驯服了……”
"It is possible," said the fox. "On the Earth one sees all sorts of things."	“这是可能的。”狐狸说，“世界上什么样的事都可能看到……”
"My life is very monotonous," the fox said. "I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not ea t bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the colour of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat…"	“我的生活很单调。我捕捉鸡，而人又捕捉我。所有的鸡全都一样，所有的人也全都一样。因此，我感到有些厌烦了。但是，如果你要是驯服了我，我的生活就一定会是欢快的。我会辨认出一种与众不同的脚步声。其他的脚步声会使我躲到地下去，而你的脚步声就会像音乐一样让我从洞里走出来。再说，你看！你看到那边的麦田没有？我不吃面包，麦子对我来说，一点用也没有。我对麦田无动于衷。而这，真使人扫兴。但是，你有着金黄色的头发。那么，一旦你驯服了我，这就会十分美妙。麦子，是金黄色的，它就会使我想起你。而且，我甚至会喜欢那风吹麦浪的声音……”
"I want to, very much," the little prince replied. "But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand."	“我是很愿意的。”小王子回答道，“可我的时间不多了。我还要去寻找朋友，还有许多事物要了解。”
"One only understands the things that one tames," said the fox. "Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me…"	“只有被驯服了的事物，才会被了解。”狐狸说，“人不会再有时间去了解任何东西的。他们总是到商人那里去购买现成的东西。因为世界上还没有购买朋友的商店，所以人也就没有朋友。如果你想要一个朋友，那就驯服我吧！”
"You must be very patient," replied the fox. "First you will sit down at a little distance from me-- like that-- in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day…"	“应当非常耐心。”狐狸回答道，“开始你就这样坐在草丛中，坐得离我稍微远些。我用眼角瞅着你，你什么也不要说。话语是误会的根源。但是，每天，你坐得靠我更近些……”
"It would have been better to come back at the same hour," said the fox. "If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you… One must observe the proper rites…"	“最好还是在原来的那个时间来。”狐狸说道，“比如说，你下午四点钟来， 那么从三点钟起，我就开始感到幸福。时间越临近，我就越感到幸福。到了四点钟的时候，我就会坐立不安；我就会发现幸福的代价。但是，如果你随便什么时候来，我就不知道在什么时候该准备好我的心情……应当有一定的仪式。”
"Those also are actions too often neglected," said the fox. "They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all."	“这也是一种早已被人忘却了的事。”狐狸说，“它就是使某一天与其他日子不同，使某一时刻与其他时刻不同。比如说，我的那些猎人就有一种仪式。他们每星期四都和村子里的姑娘们跳舞。于是，星期四就是一个美好的日子！我可以一直散步到葡萄园去。如果猎人们什么时候都跳舞，天天又全都一样，那么我也就没有假日了。”
So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near--	就这样，小王子驯服了狐狸。当出发的时刻就快要来到时：
"It is your own fault," said the little prince. "I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you…"	“这是你的过错，”小王子说，“我本来并不想给你任何痛苦，可你却要我驯服你……”
"It has done me good," said the fox, "because of the color of the wheat fields." And then he added:	“由于麦子颜色的缘故，我还是得到了好处。”狐狸说。然后，他又接着说：
"Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret."	“再去看看那些玫瑰花吧。你一定会明白，你的那朵是世界上独一无二的玫瑰。你回来和我告别时，我再赠送给你一个秘密。”
"You are not at all like my rose," he said. "As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world."	“你们一点也不像我的那朵玫瑰，你们还什么都不是呢！”小王子对她们说。“没有人驯服过你们，你们也没有驯服过任何人。你们就像我的狐狸过去那样，它那时只是和千万只别的狐狸一样的一只狐狸。但是，我现在已经把它当成了我的朋友，于是它现在就是世界上独一无二的了。”
"You are beautiful, but you are empty," he went on. "One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you-- the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose."	“你们很美，但你们是空虚的。”小王子仍然在对她们说，“没有人能为你们去死。当然罗，我的那朵玫瑰花，一个普通的过路人以为她和你们一样。可是，她单独一朵就比你们全体更重要，因为她是我浇灌的。因为她是我放在花罩中的。因为她是我用屏风保护起来的。因为她身上的毛虫（除了留下两三只为了变蝴蝶而外）是我除灭的。因为我倾听过她的怨艾和自诩，甚至有时我聆听着她的沉默。因为她是我的玫瑰。”
"Goodbye," said the fox. "And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."	“再见。”狐狸说。“喏，这就是我的秘密。很简单：只有用心才能看得清。实质性的东西，用眼睛是看不见的。”
"What is essential is invisible to the eye," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.	“实质性的东西，用眼睛是看不见的。”小王子重复着这句话，以便能把它记在心间。
"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."	“正因为你为你的玫瑰花费了时间，这才使你的玫瑰变得如此重要。”
"It is the time I have wasted for my rose--" said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.	“正因为你为你的玫瑰花费了时间……”小王子又重复着，要使自己记住这些。
"Men have forgotten this truth," said the fox. "But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose…"	“人们已经忘记了这个道理，”狐狸说，“可是，你不应该忘记它。你现在要对你驯服过的一切负责到底。你要对你的玫瑰负责……”
"I am responsible for my rose," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.	“我要对我的玫瑰负责……”小王子又重复着……
The early summer days on a farm are the happiest and fairest days of the year. Lilacs bloom and make the air sweet, and then fade. Apple blossoms come with the lilacs, and the bees visit around among the apple trees. The days grow warm and soft. School ends, and children have time to play and to fish for trouts in the brook. Avery often brought a trout home in his pocket, warm and stiff and ready to be fried for supper.	农场的初夏，是一年中最快乐最美好的时候。紫丁香开花了，把空气薰得又苦又香。等到丁香花开败了，苹果花就露出了笑脸。这时候，蜂儿们就会成群地到苹果树中间来观光了。天气渐渐变暖了。学校放假了，孩子们也更有空儿去玩耍，或者去小河里抓鳟鱼了。埃弗里经常兜里揣着一条鳟鱼回家，准备在晚饭时把它们煎着吃。
Now that school was over, Fern visited the barn almost every day, to sit quietly on her stool. The animals treated her as an equal. The sheep lay calmly at her feet.	既然放了假，芬就有更时间去参观谷仓了。她几乎每天都去，静静地坐在她的小凳上观察着。动物们已经把她当自己人看待了。绵羊安静地躺在她的脚边。
Around the first of July, the work horses were hitched to the mowing machine, and Mr. Zuckerman climbed into the seat and drove into the field. All morning you could hear the rattle of the machine as it went round and round, while the tall grass fell down behind the cutter bar in long green swathes. Next day, if there was no thunder shower, all hands would help rake and pitch and load, and the hay would be hauled to barn in the high hay wagon, with Fern and Avery riding at the top of the load. Then the hay would be hoisted, sweet and warm, into the big loft, until the whole barn seemed like a wonderful bed of timothy and clover. It was fine to jump in, and perfect to hide in. And sometimes Avery would find a little grass snake in the hay, and would add it to the other things in his pocket.	差不多在七月的第一天，祖克曼先生便开始把割草机套在马的脖子上，自己跳进座位里，赶着马往田野里去了。整个的早晨你都能听到割草机转来转去的嘎嘎声，看到高高的草渐渐的在长条割刀的后面排起了长长的绿行的情景。第二天，如果没有雷阵雨，所有的人就会来帮着用耙子把割下来的草收拢到一起，装上高高的干草车往谷仓拉，芬和埃弗里则坐到了车的最顶上。然后，暖暖的散发着清香的干草会被卸进大阁楼，直到堆得整个谷仓看起来像无数的筒状草与苜蓿铺起的奇妙的大床一样。如果你跳上去，一定感觉很舒服，躲到里面也没人看得见。偶尔，来这里玩的埃弗里能在干草堆里找到一条可爱的小草蛇，便把它和兜里的别的宝贝装到一起。
Early summer days are a jubilee time for birds. In the fields, around the house, in the barn, in the woods, in the swamp--everywhere love and songs and nests and eggs. From the edge of the woods, the white-throated sparrow(which must come all the way from Boston) calls, "Oh, Peabody, Peabody, Peabody!" On an apple bough, the phoebe teeters and wags its tail and says, "Phoebe, phoe-bee!" The song sparrow, who knows how brief and lovely life is, says, "Sweet, sweet, sweet interlude; sweet, sweet, sweet interlude." If you enter the barn, the swallows swoop down from their nests and scold. "Cheeky, cheeky!" they say.	初夏简直是鸟儿们的狂欢节。在田野间，房子四周，谷仓里，树林中，湿地上——到处都有欢爱，歌声，鸟巢和鸟蛋。白喉雀（从波士顿飞来的）在树林边叫，“啊，皮儿剥，皮儿剥，皮儿剥！”在苹果树杈间，京燕颤巍巍地晃着尾巴走来走去，嘴里喊着：“波碧，波儿-碧！”深知生命是多么可爱和短促的百灵鸟说，“快乐的，快乐的偷闲！快乐的，快乐的，快乐的偷闲。”如果你来到谷仓，就会听见燕子们从他们的巢里一头扎过去叱责。“无耻，无耻！”他们说。
In early summer there are plenty of things for a child to eat and drink and suck and chew. Dandelion stems are full of milk, clover heads are loaded with nectar, the Frigidaire is full of ice-cold drinks. Everywhere you look is life; even the little ball of spit on the weed stalk, if you poke it apart, has a green worm inside it. And on the under side of the leaf of the potato vine are the bright orange eggs of the potato bug.	初夏里有很多孩子们喜欢吃，喝，吮，嚼的好东西。蒲公英的花梗里都是乳汁，苜蓿花的芯里盛满了琼浆，冰箱里放了那么多冰凉的饮料。到处都是勃勃的生机，甚至粘在草茎上的小雪球里，也会躺着一只小绿虫，如果你把它捅开的话。在土豆枝叶的下面，还有鲜橙色的薯虫蛋呢。
It was on a day in early summer that the goose eggs hatched. This was an important event in the barn cellar. Fern was there, sitting on her stool, when it happened.	初夏的某天，小鹅们被孵出来了。在谷仓的地窖里，这可算一件大事情。当时，芬正在她的凳子上坐着呢。
Except for the goose herself, Charlotte was the first to know that the goslings had at last arrived. The goose knew a day in advance that they were coming--she could hear their weak voices calling from inside the egg. She knew that they were coming. She knew that they were in a desperately cramped position inside the shell and were most anxious to break through and get out. So she sat quite still, and talked less than usual.	除了母鹅之外，夏洛是第一个得知小鹅出世的消息的。母鹅头一天就知道小鹅们快要出来了——她听到了蛋壳里传出的微弱叫声。她知道他们已经在里面呆不安稳，急着打破蛋壳出来走走了。于是她就静静地坐着，话也比平时少多了。
When the first gosling poked its grey-green head through the goose's feathers and looked around, Charlotte spied it and made the announcement.	当第一只小鹅从鹅妈妈的羽毛里探出灰绿的小脑袋，开始四处观望时，夏洛第一个瞥见了他，并发布了一个声明。
"I am sure," she said," that every one of us here will be gratified to learn that after four weeks of unremitting effort and patience on the part of our friend the goose, she now has something to show for it. The goslings have arrived. May I offer my sincere congratulations!"	“我相信，”她说，“我们中的每一位都将高兴地获悉，经过四周的不懈努力与耐心的等待，我们的朋友母鹅终于取得了骄人的成绩。小鹅出世了。请让我在这里衷心地表示祝贺！”
"Thank you, thank you, thank you!" said the goose, nodding and bowing shamelessly.	“谢谢你，谢谢你，谢谢你！”母鹅点点头，毫不害羞地鞠了一躬。
"Congratulations!" shouted Wilbur. "How many goslings are there? I can only see one." 	“祝贺！”威伯喊。“一共有几只小鹅？我只看见一只呀。”
"Luck had nothing to do with this," said the goose. "It was good management and hard work."	“这可与什么幸运无关，”母鹅说。“这需要很好的筹划和辛苦的劳动。”
At this point, Templeton showed his nose from his hiding place under Wilbur's trough. He glanced at Fern, then crept cautiously toward the goose, keeping close to the wall. Everyone watched him, for he was not well liked, not trusted.	这时，坦普尔曼从他在威伯食槽下的藏身处露出了鼻子。他偷看了芬一眼，然后贴着墙小心地朝母鹅这边溜过来。大家都警惕地看着他，因为他既不讨人喜欢，也不被人相信。
"Look," he began in his sharp voice, "you say you have seven goslings. There were eight eggs. What happened to the other egg? Why didn't it hatch?"	“看，”他尖细地叫起来，“你说你有了七只小鹅。可共有八只蛋呢。第八只蛋怎么了？你没有孵吗？”
"What are you going to do with it?" continued Templeton, his little round beady eyes fixed on the goose.	“你将怎么处理它？”坦普尔曼那圆溜溜的小眼珠盯向母鹅，继续说道。
"You can have it," replied the goose. "Roll it away and add it to that nasty collection of yours." (Templeton had a habit of picking up unusual objects around the farm and storing them in his home. He saved everything.)	“你可以把它带走，”母鹅回答。“把它滚到你那些肮脏的收藏品里去吧。”（坦普尔曼有把农场里没人要的东西收藏到家里的习惯。他什么都收藏。）
"Certainly-ertainly-ertainly," said the gander. "You may have the egg. But I'll tell you one thing, Templeton, if I ever catch you poking-oking-oking your ugly nose around our goslings, I'll give you the worst pounding a rat ever took." And the gander opened his strong wings and beat the air with them to show his power. He was strong and brave, but the truth is, both the goose and the gander were worried about Templeton. And with good reason. The rat had no morals, no conscience, no scruples, no consideration, no decency, no milk of rodent kindness, no compunctions, no higher feeling, no friendliness, no anything. He would kill a gosling if he could get away with it--the goose knew that. Everybody knew it.	“当然-然-然，”公鹅说。“你可以拿走这只蛋。但我有件事要告诉你，坦普尔曼，如果我发现你把你那丑陋的鼻子伸-伸-伸到我们的小鹅身边的话，我就会给你一记一只耗子从来没受过的重拳。”说着，公鹅张开他强壮的翅膀，用它们使劲扑打着空气，好让老鼠看看他是多么的孔武有力。他虽然既结实又勇猛，但事实上，母鹅和公鹅还是有对坦普尔曼担心的充分理由。这只耗子不讲道义，没同情心，无所顾忌，不顾他人，没有品德，没有啮齿类动物的仁慈心肠，从不会良心不安，毫无高尚情感，没有友情，什么好的地方都没有。如果可以逃脱惩罚，他就会杀死小鹅的——母鹅深知这一点。大家也知道。
With her broad bill the goose pushed the unhatched egg out of the nest, and the entire company watched in disgust while the rat rolled it away. Even Wilbur, who could eat almost anything, was appalled. "Imagine wanting a junky old rotten egg!" he muttered.	母鹅用她扁扁的嘴巴把那只没有孵出来的蛋推到了她的巢外，全体的伙伴都带着憎恶的表情看着耗子把它搬走。甚至连几乎什么都吃的威伯见此情景也感到恶心。“想想吧，竟有人愿意要一只臭烘烘的破蛋！”他嘟囔着。
"A rat is a rat," said Charlotte. She laughed a tinkling little laugh. "But, my friends, if that ancient egg ever breaks, this barn will be untenable."	“老鼠不愧为老鼠。”夏洛的笑声好像风里的铃儿一样。“但是，我的朋友，如果这只蛋被打碎了，这个谷仓就会让人受不了的。”
"It means nobody will be able to live here on account of the smell. A rotten egg is a regular stink bomb."	“这就是说那传出的气味会薰得我们无法在这里住下去的。一只坏了的蛋通常都是非常臭的。”
"I won't break it," snarled Templeton. "I know what I'm doing. I handle stuff like this all the time."	“我不会弄破它的，”坦普尔曼气恼地说。“我知道我在干什么。我可是常搬这类东西的。”
He disappeared into his tunnel, pushing the goose egg in front of him. He pushed and nudged till he succeeded in rolling it to his lair under the trough.	他推着面前的鹅蛋钻进了他的地道。他小心地把蛋滚着，直到安全到达他在猪食槽下的窝。
That afternoon, when the wind had died down and the barnyard was quiet and warm, the grey goose led her seven goslings off the nest and out into the world. Mr. Zucherman spied them when he came with Wilbur's supper.	那天下午，当风渐弱，谷仓里变得又静又暖时，灰色的母鹅把她的七只小鹅领到了巢外的世界。祖克曼先生在给威伯送晚饭时看到了他们。
"Well, hello there!" he said, smiling all over. "Let's see...one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Seven baby geese. Now isn't that lovely!"	“哈，那是什么！”他笑着说，“让我来看看……一、二、三、四、五、六、七。七只鹅宝宝。它们多可爱呀！”
But it happened that after walking for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the little prince at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the abodes of men.	在沙漠、岩石、雪地上行走了很长的时间以后，小王子终于发现了一条大路。 所有的大路都是通往人住的地方的。
The little prince gazed at them. They all looked like his flower.	小王子瞅着这些花，它们全都和他的那朵花一样。
His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden!	他的那朵花曾对他说她是整个宇宙中独一无二的一种花。可是，仅在这一座花园里就有五千朵完全一样的这种花朵！
"She would be very much annoyed," he said to himself, "if she should see that… she would cough most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life-- for if I did not do that, to humble myself also, she would really allow herself to die…"	小王子自言自语地说：“如果她看到这些，她一定会很恼火……她会咳嗽得更厉害，并且为避免让人耻笑，她会佯装死去。那么，我还得装着去护理她，因为如果不这样的话，她为了使我难堪，她可能会真的死去……”
Then he went on with his reflections: "I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees-- and one of them perhaps extinct forever… that doesn't make me a very great prince…"	接着他又说道：“我还以为我有一朵独一无二的花呢，我有的仅是一朵普通的花。这朵花，再加上三座只有我膝盖那么高的火山，而且其中一座还可能是永远熄灭了的，这一切不会使我成为一个了不起的王子……”
"Why can't you?" asked the pig. "I'm right here."	“你为什么看不清我？”小猪问。“我就在这儿呀。”
"Yes, but I'm near-sighted," replied Charlotte. "I've always been dreadfully near-sighted. It's good in some ways, not so good in others. Watch me wrap up this fly."	“是的，不过我近视，”夏洛回答。“我的近视十分严重。这对我既有好处，也有坏处。你看我来抓住这只苍蝇。”
A fly that had been crawling along Wilbur's trough had flown up and blundered into the lower part of Charlotte's web and was tangled in the sticky threads. The fly was beating its wings furiously, trying to break loose and free itself.	一只刚才在威伯的食槽边上爬的苍蝇飞了起来，却愚蠢地碰上了夏洛的网，被那些粘粘的丝线缠住了。苍蝇愤怒地拍打着翅膀，想要挣脱。
"First," said Charlotte, "I dive at him." She plunged headfirst toward the fly. As she dropped, a tiny silken thread unwound from her rear end.	“首先，”夏洛说，“我要悄悄靠近他。”她慢慢地头朝下往苍蝇那里爬去。在她往下荡的时候，一根细丝线从她的尾部抽了出来。
"Next, I wrap him up." She grabbed the fly, threw a few jets of silk around it, and rolled it over and over, wrapping it so that it couldn't move. Wilbur watched in horror. He could hardly believe what he was seeing, and although he detested flies, he was sorry for this one.	“接着，我要把他包起来。”她抓住苍蝇，往他身上缠了几道黑丝线，丝线越绕越密，直到裹得苍蝇一动也不能动。威伯惊恐地看着这一切。他几乎不敢相信他所看到的场面，尽管他也憎恨苍蝇，可还是为这只苍蝇感到难过。
"There!" said Charlotte. "Now I knock him out, so he'll be more comfortable." She bit the fly. "He can't feel a thing now," she remarked. "He'll make a perfect breakfast for me."	“看，”夏洛说。“现在我要把他弄晕，他就会觉得舒服点儿了。”她咬了苍蝇一口。“他现在毫无知觉了，”她说，“他将是我的一顿美味的早餐。”
"Certainly. Flies, bugs, grasshoppers, choice beetles, moths, butterflies, tasty cockroaches, gnats, midges, daddy longlegs, centipedes, mosquitoes, crickets--anything that is careless enough to get caught in my web. I have to live, don't I?"	“当然。苍蝇，小虫子，蚱蜢，漂亮的甲虫，飞蛾，蝴蝶，可口的蟑螂，蚊子，小咬儿，长脚蚊子，麻蚊子，蟋蟀——任何粗心地撞到我网上的小昆虫我都吃。我总得吃饭吧，是不是？”
"Why, yes, of course," said Wilbur. "Do they taste good?"	“为什么？哦，是的，当然。”威伯说。“他们的味道美吗？”
"Delicious. Of course, I don't really eat them. I drink them--drink their blood. I love blood," said Charlotte, and her pleasant, thin voice grew even thinner and more pleasant.	“美妙极了。当然，我不是真的吃掉他们。我喝他们——喝他们的血。我喜欢喝血，”夏洛说。她的声音听起来越来越清脆，越来越快活了。
"Don't say that!" groaned Wilbur. "Please don't say things like that!"	“别再说下去了！”威伯呻吟。“请不要讲这件事儿了！”
"Why not? It's true, and I have to say what is true. I am not entirely happy about my diet of flies and bugs, but it's the way I'm made. A spider has to pick up a living somehow or other, and I happen to be a trapper. I just naturally build a web and trap flies and other insects. My mother was a trapper before me. Her mother was a trapper before her. All our family have been trappers. Way back for thousands and thousands of years we spiders have been laying for flies and bugs."	“为什么不？真的，我说的是真的。虽然我也不愿意吃苍蝇和小虫子，但那是我的生存方式。一个蜘蛛必须要设法谋生，而我恰巧可以作一名捕猎者。我生来就会织网，用它来捕食苍蝇和别的昆虫。在我之前，我的妈妈是一个捕猎者；在她之前，她的妈妈也是。我们全家都是捕猎者。千百万年以前，我们蜘蛛就靠捕食苍蝇和虫子为生了。”
"It's a miserable inheritance," said Wilbur, gloomily. He was sad because his new friend was so bloodthirsty.	“那是多么可悲的遗传。”威伯幽幽地说。他真为新朋友的残忍难过。
"Yes, it is," agreed charlotte. "But I can't help it. I don't know how the first spider in the early days of the world happened to think up this fancy idea of spinning a web, but she did, and it was clever of her, too. And since then, all of us spiders have had to work the same trick. It's not a bad pitch, on the whole."	“是的，”夏洛表示同意。“但我也没办法改变这特性。我不知道世上最早的第一只蜘蛛是怎么想出织网这个奇妙的主意的，可是她却想出来了，她可真聪明。从那时起，我们所有的蜘蛛都会这么做了。总的来说，这个发明不坏。”
"It's cruel," replied Wilbur, who did not intend to be argued out of his position.	“这是残酷的发明。”威伯简捷地回答。他并不打算为此而争论。
"Well, you can't talk," said Charlotte. "You have your meals brought to you in a pail. Nobody feeds me. I have to get my own living. I live by my wits. I have to be sharp and clever, lest I go hungry. I have to think things out, catch what I can, take what comes. And it just so happens, my friend, that what comes is flies and insects and bugs. And furthermore," said Charlotte, shaking one of her legs, "do you realize that if I didn't catch bugs and eat them, bugs would increase and multiply and get so numerous that they'd destroy the earth, wipe out everything?"	“噢，你不能这么说，”夏洛说。“你有别人给你送饭吃。可没人喂我呀。我不得不独力谋生。我只有靠我的智力活着。为了避免挨饿，我只好变得又敏捷又聪明。我不得不想方设法，去抓住我能抓到的东西，享用他们的血。就是这么回事儿，我的朋友，我吃的就是我抓到的苍蝇和别的小昆虫。此外，”夏洛说着，挥起一条腿儿，“你明白如果我不抓小虫子吃，小虫子们就会增多，繁殖，直到多得足以破坏地球，毁灭一切吗？”
"Really?" said Wilbur. "I wouldn't want that to happen. Perhaps your web is a good thing after all."	“真的吗？”威伯说。“我可不想发生这种事。可能你的网真是个好东西吧。”
The goose had been listening to this conversation and chuckling to herself. "There are a lot of things Wilbur doesn't know about life," she thought. "He's really a very innocent little pig. He doesn't even know what's going to happen to him around Christmastime; he has no idea that Mr. Zuckerman and Lurvy are plotting to kill him." And the goose raised herself a bit and poked her eggs a little further under her so that they would receive the full heat from her warm body and soft feathers.	一直听着这场对话的母鹅嘎嘎自语。“对于生活，威伯不懂的还多着呢。”她想。“他真是一头天真的小猪。他甚至都不知道圣诞节会发生什么事儿呢；他根本就不知道祖克曼先生和鲁维正在密谋杀掉他呢。”母鹅稍稍抬抬身子，把她的蛋往身下推得更近些，以便他们能更好的接收到她温暖的身体和柔软的羽毛下面的热量。
Charlotte stood quietly over the fly, preparing to eat it. Wilbur lay down and closed his eyes. He was tired from his wakeful night and from the excitement of meeting someone for the first time. A breeze brought him the smell of clover--the sweet-smelling world beyond his fence. "Well," he thought," I've got a new friend, all right. But what a gamble friendship is! Charlotte is fierce, brutal, scheming, bloodthirsty--everything I don't like. How can I learn to like her, even though she is pretty and, of course, clever?	夏洛在苍蝇的上方静停了一会儿，准备去吃它了。威伯忙闭上双眼，躺了下来。昨晚没睡好，再加上首次遇到新朋友的激动，使他感到分外的疲倦。微风把苜蓿的香味给他送了过来——他的栅栏外的世界里充满了甜香的气息。“很好，”他想，“我有了一个新朋友，真不错。但这是多危险的友谊呀！夏洛凶猛，残酷，狡诈，嗜血——这些我都不喜欢。虽然她是那么可爱，当然，也很聪明，可我怎么能让自己去试着喜欢她呢？”
Wilbur was merely suffering the doubts and fears that often go with finding a new friend. In good time he was to discover that he was mistaken about Charlotte. Underneath her rather bold and cruel exterior, she had a kind heart, and she was to prove loyal and true to the very end.	威伯像那些初交新朋友的人一样，被猜疑和恐惧困绕着。以后，他将发现自己误解了夏洛。其实，在她那可怕冷漠的外表下，有着一颗善良的心，以后发生的事情将证明，她对朋友是忠实，真诚的，每一刻都是如此。
The night seemed long. Wilbur's stomach was empty and his mind was full. And when your stomach is empty and your mind is full, it's always hard to sleep.	夜好像变长了。威伯的肚子是空的，脑子里却装得满满的。当你的肚子是空的，可脑子里却满是心事的时候，总是很难入睡的。
A dozen times during the night Wilbur woke and stared into the blackness, listening to the sounds and trying to figure out what time it was. A barn is never perfectly quiet. Even at midnight there is usually something stirring.	这一夜，威伯醒了很多次。醒时他就拼命朝黑暗中望着，听着，想弄明白是几点钟了。谷仓从没有完全安静的时候，甚至在半夜里也还是老有响动。
The first time he woke, he heard Templeton gnawing a hole in the grain bin. Templeton's teeth scraped loudly against the wood and made quite a racket. "That crazy rat!" thought Wilbur. "Why does he have to stay up all night, grinding his clashers and destroying people's property? Why can't he go to sleep, like any decent animal?" 	第一次醒来时，他听到坦普尔曼在谷仓里打洞的声音。坦普尔曼的牙使劲儿地嗑着木头，弄出很大的动静。“那只疯耗子！”威伯想。“为什么他整夜的在那里磨牙，破坏人们的财产？为什么他不去睡觉，像任何一只正常的动物那样？”
The second time Wilbur woke, he heard the goose turning on her nest and chuckling to herself.	第二次醒来时，威伯听到母鹅在她的窝里来回挪着，自顾自的傻笑。
"Probably-obably-obably about half-past eleven," said the goose, "Why aren't you asleep, Wilbur?"	“可能-能-能十一点半了吧，”母鹅说。“你为什么不睡，威伯？”
"Well," said the goose, "that's not my trouble. I have nothing at all on my mind, but I've too many things under my behind. Have you ever tried to sleep while sitting on eight eggs?"	“唔，”母鹅说。“我没这样的麻烦。我脑子里什么东西都没有，不过我的屁股下面倒有很多东西。你试过坐在八个蛋上睡觉吗？”
"No," replied Wilbur, "I suppose it is uncomfortable. How long does it take a goose egg to hatch?"	“没有，”威伯回答。“我猜那一定很不舒服，一个鹅蛋得孵多久？”
"Approximately-oximately thirty days, all told," answered the goose. "But I cheat a little. On warm afternoons, I just pull a little straw over the eggs and go out for a walk."	“他们说大约-约要三十天，”母鹅回答。“可我有时会偷懒。在温暖的午后，我常衔来一些稻草把蛋盖上，一个人去散步。”
Wilbur yawned and went back to sleep. In his dreams he heard again the voice saying, "I'll be a friend to you. Go to sleep--you'll see me in the morning."	威伯打了个哈欠，进入了梦乡。梦里他又仿佛听到了那个声音，“我将成为你的朋友。去睡吧——明早你会看见我。”
About half an hour before dawn, Wilbur woke and listened. The barn was still dark. The sheep lay motionless. Even the goose was quiet. Overhead, on the main floor, nothing stirred: the cows were resting, the horses dozed. Templeton had quit work and gone off somewhere on an errand. The only sound was a slight scraping noise from the rooftop, where the weather-vane swung back and forth. Wilbur loved the barn when it was like this--calm and quiet, waiting for light.	大约在天亮前的半小时，威伯醒了，开始倾听。谷仓里还是很黑。绵羊睡得很沉。甚至那只母鹅也很安静。头上的主楼那里也没什么动静：牛正在休息，马在打盹儿。坦普尔曼也不见了，可能到别处工作去了吧。只有谷仓顶上才有些轻微的响动，那是风信鸡在风里晃来晃去。威伯很喜欢这时的谷仓——一切都那么静谧，安详，只等曙光的来临。
Through a small window, a faint gleam appeared. One by one the stars went out. Wilbur could see the goose a few feet away. She sat with head tucked under a wing. Then he could see the sheep and the lambs. The sky lightened.	一缕微光从小窗子里透了进来。星星们一个接一个的熄灭了。威伯现在能看清几步远的母鹅了。她的头藏到了翅膀的下面。接着，他也能看清绵羊和羊羔了。天亮了。
"Oh, beautiful day, it is here at last! Today I shall find my friend."	“哦，美丽的白天，它终于来了！今天我会找到朋友了。”
Wilbur looked everywhere. He searched his pen thoroughly. He examined the window ledge, stared up at the ceiling. But he saw nothing new. Finally he decided he would have to speak up. He hated to break the lovely stillness of dawn by using his voice, but he couldn't think of any other way to locate the mysterious new friend who was nowhere to be seen. So Wilbur cleared his throat.	威伯四处搜寻着。他把家里查了个遍。他检查了窗台，又望了望天花板。但却什么新变化都没发现。最后他只好决定喊话了。尽管他不愿用自己的声音来打破这可爱的黎明时分的寂静，但他想不出还有什么别的办法可以找出那位无处可见的，神秘的新朋友。因此威伯清了清嗓子。
"Attention, please!" he said in a loud, firm voice. "Will the party who addressed me at bedtime last night kindly make himself or herself known by giving an appropriate sign or signal!"	“请注意！”他用特别洪亮的嗓门说，“请在昨晚就寝时友好地和我谈话的那位先生或女士给我打一个手势，或者发个信号！”
Wilbur paused and listened. All the other animals lifted their heads and stared at him. Wilbur blushed. But he was determined to get in touch with his unknown friend.	威伯停下来，听了听。别的动物都抬起头瞪向他。威伯脸红了。但他还是决心找出这个陌生的朋友。
"Attention, please!" he said. "I will repeat the message. Will the party who addressed me at bedtime last night kindly speak up. Please tell me where you are, if you are my friend!"	“请注意！”他说。“我再重复一遍。请昨夜睡前和我亲切谈话的朋友出来说话。请告诉我你在哪里，如果你是我的朋友的话！”
"Stop your nonsense, Wilbur!" said the oldest sheep. "If you have a new friend here, you are probably disturbing his rest; and the quickest way to spoil a friendship is to wake somebody up in the morning before he is ready. How can you be sure your friend is an early riser?"	“别说胡话了，威伯！”最老的绵羊说。“如果你在这里有一个新朋友，你就是在妨害他的休息；而且在他早晨准备起床前把他吵醒，也是打破友谊的最快方法。你能确定你的朋友喜欢早起吗？”
"I beg everyone's pardon," whispered Wilbur. "I didn't mean to be objectionable."	“各位，请原谅，”威伯的声音低了下来。“我并不想打扰别人。”
He lay down meekly in the in the manure, facing the door. He did not know it, but his friend was very near. and the old sheep was right--the friend was still asleep.	他脸朝门委屈地躺了下来。他没想到会打扰别人，但如果他的朋友就在不远，早就该听到了。可能老羊说得对——这个朋友还没睡醒呢。
Soon Lurvy appeared with slops for breakfast. Wilbur rushed out, ate everything in a hurry, and licked the trough. The sheep moved off down the lane, the gander waddled along behind them, pulling grass. And then, just as Wilbur was settling down for his morning nap, he heard again the thin voice that had addressed him the night before.	不久鲁维来送早饭了。威伯冲出去急忙把食物吃光，还把食槽舔了个遍。绵羊们向小路走去，后面跟着摇摇摆摆的公鹅。就在威伯准备躺下来睡个早觉时，他又听到了昨夜的那种声音。
"What are they, and where are you?" screamed Wilbur. "Please, please, tell me where you are. And what are salutations?"	“这个词儿是什么意思，你又在哪儿？”威伯尖叫起来。“求求你，求求你，告诉我你在哪儿吧。还有，致敬是什么意思？”
"Salutations are greetings," said the voice. "When I say 'salutations,' it's just my fancy way of saying hello or good morning. Actually, it's a silly expression, and I am surprised that I used it at all. As for my whereabouts, that's easy. Look up here in the corner of the dooway! Here I am. Look, I'm waving!"	“致敬是句问候用语，”那个声音说道。“当我说‘致敬’，就等于对你说‘你好’或是‘早上好’。实际上，这是种愚蠢的表达方式，真奇怪我刚才怎么会用这么一个词儿。你想知道我在哪儿吗？那很容易。往门框上角看！我在这儿。看，我在挥手哩！”
At last Wilbur saw the creature that had spoken to him in such a kindly way. Stretched across the upper part of the doorway was a big spiderweb, and hanging from the top of the web, head down, was a large grey spider. She was about the size of a gumdrop. She had eight legs, and she was waving one of them at Wilbur in friendly greeting. "See me now?" she asked.	威伯终于找到了如此友善的和自己交谈的动物。门框的上方拉着一张大蜘蛛网，一只大灰蜘蛛正倒挂在网的高处。她只有一粒树胶糖丸那么大。她长着八条腿，正用其中的一条腿友好地对威伯致意呢。“现在看到我了？”她问。
"Oh, yes indeed," said Wilbur. "Yes indeed! How are you? Good morning! Salutations! Very pleased to meet you. What is your name, please? May I have your name?"	“噢，确实看见了，”威伯说。“确实看见了！你好！早上好！致敬！很高兴认识你。请问芳名？我可以问你的名字吗？”
"Charlotte A. Cavatica. But just call me Charlotte."	“夏洛·A·卡瓦蒂娜。你就叫我夏洛好了。”
"Well, I am pretty," replied Charlotte. "There's no denying that. Almost all spiders are rather nice-looking. I'm not as flashy as some, but I'll do. I wish I could see you, Wilbur, as clearly as you can see me."	“谢谢，我是很漂亮，”夏洛回答。“那是毫无疑问的。几乎所有的蜘蛛都长得相当好看。我不像别的蜘蛛那么艳丽，不过我也算可以了。我希望能看清你，威伯，就像你能看清我一样。”
After that, the little prince climbed a high mountain. The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes, which came up to his knees. And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool. "From a mountain as high as this one," he said to himself, "I shall be able to see the whole planet at one glance, and all the people…"	小王子爬上一座高山。过去他所见过的山就是那三座只有他膝盖那么高的火山，并且他把那座熄灭了的火山就当作凳子。小王子自言自语地说道：“从这么高的山上，我一眼可以看到整个星球，以及所有的人。”
"Good morning--Good morning--Good morning," answered the echo.	“你好——你好——你好——”回音在回答道。
"Who are you--Who are you--Who are you?" answered the echo.	“你们是什么人——你们是什么人——你们是什么人——回音又回答道。
"I am all alone--all alone--all alone," answered the echo.	“我很孤独——我很孤独——我很孤独——”回音又回答着。
"What a queer planet!" he thought. "It is altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether harsh and forbidding. And the people have no imagination. They repeat whatever one says to them… On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak…"	小王子想道：“这颗行星真奇怪！它上面全是干巴巴的，而且又尖利又咸涩，人们一点想象力都没有。他们只是重复别人对他们说的话……在我的家乡，我有一朵花。她总是自己先说话……”
The next day was rainy and dark. Rain fell on the roof of the barn and dripped steadily from the eaves. Rain fell in the barnyard and ran in crooked courses down into the lane where thistles and pigweed grew. Rain spattered against Mrs. Zuckerman's kitchen windows and came gushing out of the downspouts. Rain fell on the backs of the sheep as they grazed in the meadow. When the sheep tired of standing in the rain, they walked slowly up the lane and into the fold.	第二天是个阴沉的雨天。雨珠儿落到谷仓上面，又一滴滴地从屋檐上滑了下来。雨珠儿落到谷仓旁边的地上，一路溅跳到长满刺儿菜和灰菜的小路里面。雨珠儿轻轻拍打着祖克曼太太厨房的窗子，顺着玻璃汩汩地往下淌。雨珠儿也落到正在草地吃草的绵羊们的背上。当绵羊们在雨中吃腻了，便慢吞吞地沿着小路回到了羊圈里。
Rain upset Wilbur's plans. Wilbur had planned to go out, this day, and dig a new hole in his yard. He had other plans, too. His plans for the day went something like this:	雨打乱了威伯的所有计划。今天威伯本打算出去散个步，在他的院子里掘一个新坑呢。而且他还有其他的计划。他今天的所有计划大致如下：
Breakfast at six-thirty. Skim milk, crusts, middlings, bits of doughnuts, wheat cakes with drops of maple syrup sticking to them, potato skins, leftover custard pudding with raisins, and bits of Shredded Wheat.	六点半吃早饭。早饭包括脱脂奶，面包渣儿，粗麦粉，一小块油煎圈饼，上面沾着枫蜜的麦糕，土豆皮，缀着葡萄干的小块布丁，零碎的麦片。
From seven to eight, Wilbur planned to have a talk with Templeton, the rat that lived under his trough. Talking with Templeton was not the most interesting occupation in the world but it was better than nothing.	从七点到八点，威伯打算和住在他的食槽下面的耗子坦普尔曼谈天儿。虽然和坦普尔曼谈天不是这世上最有趣的事情，但至少比什么都不做要好。
From eight to nine, Wilbur planned to take a nap outdoors in the sun.	八点到九点，威伯想在外面的太阳下打一个盹儿。
From nine to eleven he planned to dig a hole, or trench, and possibly find something good to eat buried in the dirt.	九点到十一点，他打算挖一个洞，或者一条小沟也行，没准儿还能从脏土里翻出什么好吃的呢。
From eleven to twelve he planned to stand still and watch flies on the boards, watch bees in the clover, and watch swallows in the air.	十一点到十二点，他只想默默地站着，瞧瞧落在木板上的苍蝇，瞅瞅在苜蓿花间的蜜蜂，望望天空里的燕子。
Twelve o'clock-lunchtime. Middlings, warm water, apple parings, meat gravy, carrot scrapings, meat scraps, stale hominy, and the wrapper off a package of cheese. Lunch would be over at one.	十二点钟——该吃午餐了。午饭有粗麦粉，温水，苹果皮，肉汁，尖尖的胡萝卜，肉末儿，陈玉米粒儿，去皮的干酪。用餐将在下午一点结束。
From three to four, he planned to stand perfectly still and think of what it was like to be alive, and to wait for Fern.	三点到四点，他打算静默而又完美地站在地上，想想生活的乐趣到底是什么，并且等芬来看他。
At four would come supper. Skim milk, provender, leftover sandwich from Lurvy's lunchbox, prune skins, a morsel of this, a bit of that, fried potatoes, marmalade drippings, a little more of this, a little more of that, a piece of baked apple, a scrap of upside down cake.	四点钟吃晚饭。晚饭有脱脂奶，剩饭，鲁维的午餐盒里剩下的三明治，干梅皮，一小片这个，一小块那个，还有炸薯片，稀稀的果酱，一点儿苹果干，一块蛋糕等等这些那些东西。
Wilbur had gone to sleep thinking about these plans. He awoke at six and saw the rain, and it seemed as though he couldn't bear it.	昨晚睡觉时，威伯还一直想着这些计划。可是今早六点睁开眼，却看到外面正在下雨，这可真让他无法忍受。
"I get every thing all beautifully planned out and it has to go and rain," he said.	“我把计划订得多么完美呀，可天却下起了雨，”他说。
For a while he stood gloomily indoors. Then he walked to the door and looked out. Drops of rain struck his face. His yard was cold and wet. his trough had and inch of rainwater in it. Templeton was nowhere to be seen.	他忧郁地在屋里站了一会儿。然后他走到门口往外看。雨滴撞到了他的脸。他的院子里又冷又湿。他的食槽里足有一英寸厚的雨水。不知道坦普尔曼躲到哪儿去了。
"Are you out there, Templeton?" called Wilbur. There was no answer. Suddenly Wilbur felt lonely and friendless.	“你在吗，坦普尔曼？”威伯喊道。没有谁回答他。陡然间，威伯觉得自己是那么的孤独，无助。
"One day just like another," he groaned. "I'm very young, I have no real friend here in the barn, it's going to rain all morning and all afternoon, and Fern won't come in such bad weather. Oh, honestly!" And Wilbur was crying again, for the second time in two days.	“今天就像昨天一样没劲，”他叹息。“我很年轻，我在谷仓里没有真正的朋友，雨会下一早晨，甚至整个下午，这样的坏天气，芬可能也不会出来。唉，她准不会来！”威伯又难过得哭起来，这两天里，他已经哭了两次了。
At six-thirty Wilbur heard the banging of a pail. Lurvy was standing outside in the rain, stirring up breakfast.	六点半，威伯听到了食桶晃动的声音。鲁维正在外面的雨里给自己准备早饭呢。
Wilbur did not budge. Lurvy dumped the slops, scraped the pail and walked away. He noticed that something was wrong with the pig.	威伯动都懒得动。鲁维把饲料倒进食槽，又刮了刮桶壁，才走开了。他注意到小猪好像有毛病了。
Wilbur didn't want food, he wanted love. He wanted a friend--someone who would play with him. He mentioned this to the goose, who was sitting quietly in a corner of the sheepfold.	威伯想要的不是食物，而是关爱。他想有一个朋友——某个能和他一起玩儿的人。他把这心思对在羊圈角落里静静坐着的母鹅讲了出来。
"Sorry, sonny, sorry," said the goose. "I'm sitting-sitting on my eggs. Eight of them. Got to keep them toasty-oasty-oasty warm. I have to stay right here, I'm no flibberty-ibberty-gibbet. I do not play when there are eggs to hatch. I'm expecting goslings."	“抱歉，宝贝儿，抱歉，”母鹅说。”我正在孵我的蛋呢。他们共有八个，得时刻让他们又干-干-干又暖。因此我只好呆在这儿，不能走-走-走开。我孵蛋时不能玩儿。我盼着能早点孵出小鹅来。”
"Well, I didn't think you were expecting wood-peckers," said Wilbur, bitterly.	“当然，我想你一定不愿孵出一群啄木鸟来，”威伯酸溜溜地说。
"Certainly not," said the lamb. "In the first place, I cannot get into your pen, as I am not old enough to jump over the fence. In the second place, I am not interested in pigs. Pigs mean less than nothing to me."	“当然不能了，”一只羊羔说。“首先，我无法进到你的院子里，因为我还太小，跳不过这篱笆。其次，我对猪一点儿也不感兴趣。照我看，猪比啥都不是还不是。”
"What do you mean, less than nothing?" replied Wilbur. "I don't think there is any such thing as less than nothing. Nothing is absolutely the limit of nothingness. It's the lowest you can go. It's the end of the line. How can something be less than nothing? If there were something that was less than nothing, then nothing would not be nothing, it would be something--even though it's just a very little bit of something. But if nothing is nothing, then nothing has nothing that is less than it is."	“什么叫比啥都不是还不是？”威伯回答。“我不认为有什么东西会比啥都不是还不是。'啥都不是'已经不是到了顶了，那绝对是天地的顶端，世界的尽头了。怎么可能还会有比啥都不是还不是的东西呢？要是你说得对，那'啥都不是'就该是点啥，哪怕只是那么一丁点儿。但是如果'啥都不是'就是'啥都不是'，那么你就找不到会比啥都不是还不是的东西。”
"Oh, be quiet!" said the lamb. "Go play by yourself! I don't play with pigs."	“哎呀，吵死了！”羊羔说。“自己上一边儿玩去！我就是不和猪一起玩儿。”
Sadly, Wilbur lay down and listened to the rain. Soon he saw the rat climbing down a slanting board that he used as a stairway.	威伯悲伤地躺下来，去听雨的声音。不久，他看见耗子正在顺着一块他自称为楼梯的，斜放在那里的木板往下爬。
"Will you play with me, Templeton?" asked Wilbur.	“你愿意和我玩儿吗，坦普尔曼？”威伯恳求。
"Play?" said Templeton, twirling his whiskers. "Play? I hardly know the meaning of the word."	“玩儿？”坦普尔曼说着，捻了捻他的胡子。“玩儿？我都不懂这词儿是什么意思。”
"Well," said Wilbur, "it means to have fun, to frolic, to run and skip and make merry."	“哦，”威伯说，“玩就是做游戏，嬉耍，跑跳，找乐子。”
"I never do those things if I can avoid them, " replied the rat, sourly. "I prefer to spend my time eating, gnawing, spying, and hiding. I am a glutton but not a merry-maker. Right now I am on my way to your trough to eat your breakfast, since you haven't got sense enough to eat it yourself." And Templeton, the rat, crept stealthily along the wall and disappeared into a private tunnel that he had dug between the door and the trough in Wilbur's yard. Templeton was a crafty rat, and he had things pretty much his own way. The tunnel was an example of his skill and cunning. The tunnel enabled him to get from the barn to his hiding place under the pig trough without coming out into the open. He had tunnels and runways all over Mr. Zuckerman's farm and could get from one place to another without being seen. Usually he slept during the daytime and was abroad only after dark.	“我从不愿意在这些事儿上浪费时间。”耗子冷冷地回答。“我宁愿把我的时间用在吃，咬，偷，藏上面。我是一个贪吃的老鼠，不是游戏主义者。我要去吃你食槽里的早餐了，反正现在你也不想去吃。”老鼠坦普尔曼说完，便沿着墙缝爬进他开凿的那条贯穿门和食槽的秘密通道里去了。坦普尔曼是只非常狡猾的耗子，也很有些高明的手段。这条通道不过是他的狡猾与挖洞技巧的一个证明而已。这条通道能令他不用在谷仓的明处露面，就能在谷仓和自己在猪食槽下的藏身处来回。他在祖克曼先生的农场里挖了很多条地道，这样就可以不被发现的任意来去了。通常他都在白天睡觉，夜深才出来活动。
Wilbur watched him disappear into his tunnel. In a moment he saw the rat's sharp nose poke out from underneath the wooden trough. Cautiously Templeton pulled himself up over the edge of the trough. This was almost more than Wilbur could stand: on this dreary, rainy day to see his breakfast being eaten by somebody else. He knew Templeton was getting soaked, out there in the pouring rain, but even that didn't comfort him. Friendless, dejected, and hungry, he threw himself down in the manure and sobbed.	威伯看着他爬进了通道。瞬间来历，他就看见耗子的尖鼻头从木头食槽下面探出来。坦普尔曼小心地顺着食槽边爬了进去。威伯几乎再也不能忍受了：谁愿意在一个忧伤的下雨天，看到自己的早餐被别人吃掉呢？他知道外面的雨水正浇着在那里大嚼的坦普尔曼，可这也不会使他感到有所安慰。无助，失意，饥饿……他趴在牛粪堆里啜泣起来。
Late that afternoon, Lurvy went to Mr. Zuckerman. "I think there's something wrong with that pig of yours. He hasn't touched his food." 	傍晚，鲁维去见祖克曼先生。“我想你的猪有毛病了。他没吃食。”
"Give him two spoonfuls of sulphur and a little molasses," said Mr. Zuckerman. 	“给他喝两勺硫磺，里面和点儿糖水。”祖克曼先生说。
Wilbur couldn't believe what happening to him when Lurvy caught him and forced the medicine down his throat. This was certainly the worst day of his life. He didn't know whether he could endure the awful loneliness any more. 	当鲁维抓住威伯，强行把药水灌到他喉咙里时，威伯还不能相信这些发生在自己身上的事。这是他一生中最糟糕的一天。他不知道自己是否还能再忍受这可怕的孤独了。
Darkness settled over everything. Soon there were only shadows and the noises of the sheep chewing their cuds, and occasionally the rattle of a cow-chain up overhead. You can imagine Wilbur's surprise when, out of the darkness, came a small voice he had never heard before. It sounded rather thin, but pleasant. "Do you want a friend, Wilbur?" it said. "I'll be a friend to you. I've watched you all day and I like you." 	黑暗朦胧了一切。不久，除了影子和绵羊咀嚼的声音，还有头顶的牛牵动链子发出的哗啦声外，什么也感觉不到了。所以你一定能想象得出，当一个从未听见过的纤细的声音从黑夜中传出来时，威伯是多么的惊奇。这声音相当的微弱，但听来却那么使人愉快。“你想要一个朋友吗，威伯？”那个声音说。“我将成为你的朋友。我已经观察你好多天了，我喜欢你。”
"But I can't see you," said Wilbur, jumping to his feet. "Where are you? And who are you?" 	“可我看不见你呀，”威伯说着，踮起脚来寻找。“你在哪儿，你是谁？”
"I'm right up here," said the voice. "Go to sleep. You'll see me in the morning." 	“我就在这儿，”那个声音说。“你先睡吧。明早你就会看到我了。”
The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower. It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all.	小王子穿过沙漠。他只见过一朵花，一个有着三枚花瓣的花朵，一朵很不起眼的小花。
"Men?" she echoed. "I think there are six or seven of them in existence. I saw them, several years ago. But one never knows where to find them. The wind blows them away. They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult."	“人吗？我想大约有六七个人，几年前，我瞅见过他们。可是，从来不知道到什么地方去找他们。风吹着他们到处跑。他们没有根，这对他们来说是很不方便的。”
"I can see that," replied Wilbur. He gave a jump in the air, twirled, ran a few steps, stopped, looked all around, sniffed the smells of afternoon, and then set off walking down through the orchard. Pausing in the shade of an apple tree, he put his strong snout into the ground and began pushing, digging, and rooting. He felt very happy. He had plowed up quite a piece of ground before anyone noticed him. Mrs. Zuckerman was the first to see him. She saw him from the kitchen window, and she immediately shouted for the men.	“我明白你的意思，”威伯回答。他在空气中跳跃着，转了几个圈儿，又跑了几步，才停了下来，四处搜寻着，嗅着午后的气息，不久，他向果园走去。他停到一棵苹果树荫下，把他强壮的鼻子插进土里，开始尽情地拱、挖、掘。他感到非常的快活。在有人注意到他之前，他已经掘起很多土了。祖克曼太太是第一个看见他的。她从厨房的窗子里望见了他，便开始喊人。
"Ho-mer!" she cried. "Pig's out! Lurvy! Pig's out! Homer! Lurvy! Pig's out. He's down there under that apple tree."	“霍——默！”她喊。“猪跑出来了！鲁维！猪跑了！霍默！鲁维！猪跑了。他在那棵苹果树下面呢。”
"Now the trouble starts," thought Wilbur. "Now I'll catch it."	“现在麻烦来了，”威伯想。“现在我要被抓住了。”
The goose heard the racket and she, too, started hollering. "Run-run-run downhill, make for the woods, the woods!" she shouted to Wilbur. "They'll never-never-never catch you in the woods."	母鹅也听见了她的吵嚷，便对威伯大喊。“跑-跑-跑到下坡去，往树林里跑，树林！”她拼命地嚷。“他们在树林里永远-永远-永远抓不住你。”
The cocker spaniel heard the commotion and he ran out from the barn to join the chase. Mr. Zuckerman heard, and he came out of the machine shed where he was mending a tool. Lurvy, the hired man, heard the noise and came up from the asparagus patch where he was pulling weeds. Everybody walked toward Wilbur and Wilbur didn't know what to do. The woods seemed a long way off, and anyway, he had never been down there in the woods and wasn't sure he would like it.	听到这场骚动的长毛狗从谷仓里跑出去追。祖克曼先生听到喊声，忙从工作间里跑出来，放下了手中正在修理的农具。在龙须菜地里拔草的雇工鲁维，听到喊声，也赶紧跑了出来。每个人都在朝威伯逼近！威伯不知所措了。到树林的路似乎是那么远，而且，他还从没进过树林，也不知道是否会喜欢呆在树林里呢。
"Get around behind him, Lurvy," said Mr. Zuckerman, "and drive him toward the barn! And take it easy-don't rush him! I'll go and get a bucket of slops."	“绕到他身后去，鲁维，”祖克曼先生说，“把他朝谷仓这边赶！小心点儿——别吓坏他！我去拿一桶猪食来。”
The news of Wilbur's escape spread rapidly among the animals on the place. Whenever any creature broke loose on Zuckerman's farm, the event was of great interest to the others. The goose shouted to the nearest cow that Wilbur was free, and soon all the cows knew. Then one of the cows told one of the sheep, and soon all the sheep knew. The lambs learned about it from their mothers. The horses, in their stalls in the barn, pricked up their ears when they heard the goose hollering; and soon the horses had caught on to what was happening. "Wilbur's out," they said. Every animal stirred and lifted its head and became excited to know that one of his friends had got free and was no longer penned up or tied fast.	威伯逃跑的消息在这里的动物中间迅速传开了。以前从没有任何一只动物能逃离祖克曼先生的农场呢，因此这事情引起了大家极大的兴趣。母鹅对离她最近的母牛嚷道，威伯自由了，不久所有的母牛都知道了这个新闻。然后一头母牛把这消息告诉了一只绵羊，不久所有的绵羊也知道了。羊羔们又从他们的母亲那里了解了一切。谷仓的马厩里的马们，竖起的耳朵也听到了母鹅的喊叫，因此不久所有的马也明白发生了什么事儿。“威伯逃了，”他们说。每一个动物都兴奋地抬起头，变得分外的激动，因为他们知道他们的一个朋友已经获得了自由，再不用被紧紧的关在圈里了。
Wilbur didn't know what to do or which way to run. It seemed as through everybody was after him. "If this is what it's like to be free," he thought, "I believe I'd rather be penned up in my own yard." The cocker spaniel was sneaking up on him from one side. Lurvy the hired man was sneaking up on him from the other side. Mrs. Zuckerman stood ready to head him off if he started for the garden, and now Mr. Zuckerman was coming down toward him carrying a pail." This is really awful," thought Wilbur. "Why doesn't Fern come?" He began to cry.	威伯不知该怎么做，往哪里跑。看起来好像每个人都在追他。“如果这就是美好的自由，”他想，“我还不如被关在我自己的院子里呢。”长毛狗从一边悄悄地靠过来，雇工鲁维也正从另一边渐渐逼近。祖克曼太太摆出了一副准备拦截的架势——如果威伯要往花园里跑的话。现在，祖克曼先生拎着桶正朝威伯走过来。“这真太可怕了，”威伯想。“为什么芬还不来？”他开始哭了。
"Don't just stand there, Wilbur! Dodge about, dodge about!" cried the goose." Skip around, run toward me, slip in and out, in and out, in and out! Make for the woods! Twist and turn!"	“别傻站着，威伯！快逃，快逃！”母鹅大叫。“转圈跳，往我这边儿跳，溜过来冲出去，过来出去，过来出去！往树林跑！迂回前进！”
The cocker spaniel sprang for Wilbur's hind leg. Wilbur jumped and ran. Lurvy reached out and grabbed. Mrs. Zuckerman screamed at Lurvy. The goose cheered for Wilbur. Wilbur dodged between Lurvy's legs. Lurvy missed Wilbur and grabbed the spaniel instead. "Nicely done, nicely done!" cried the goose. "Try it again, try it again!"	长毛狗猛地蹿起来咬向威伯的后腿。威伯蹦着高儿跑开。鲁维冲上前去抓威伯。祖克曼太太对鲁维尖叫起来。母鹅还在为威伯加油。威伯从鲁维的双腿间逃了出去，鲁维没有抓到威伯，反一把搂住了长毛狗。“干得好，干得好！”母鹅叫道。“再来一个，再来一个！”
Poor Wilbur was dazed and frightened by this hullabaloo. He didn't like being the center of all this fuss. He tried to follow the instructions his friends were giving him, but he couldn't run downhill and uphill at the same time, and he couldn't turn and twist when he was jumping and dancing, and he was crying so hard he could barely see anything that was happening. After all, Wilbur was a very young pig-not much more than a baby, really. He wished Fern were there to take him in his arms and comfort him. When he looked up and saw Mr. Zuckerman standing quite close to him, holding a pail of warm slops, he felt relieved. He lifted his nose and sniffed. The smell was delicious-warm milk, potato skins, wheat middlings, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, and a popover left from the Zuckermans' breakfast.	可怜的威伯被他们的乱叫弄得又晕又怕。他可不喜欢成为这些乱子的焦点。他本想试着听从朋友们给他的建议，可他不能同时既往上坡跑，又往下坡跑，而且，他也不能一边蹦起来一边迂回前进，更何况他哭喊得这么厉害，几乎弄不清周围都发生了什么事。真的，威伯毕竟只不过是一头比婴儿大不多少的小猪罢了。他只希望芬此刻在场，能把自己抱起来安慰一番。当他抬头看到祖克曼先生就静静地站在身旁，手里拎着盛满热乎乎的稀饭的食桶时，才稍稍宽了心。他耸起鼻子使劲儿闻着。那些味道多鲜美呀——有热牛奶，土豆皮，粗麦粉，凯洛格牌玉米片，还有祖克曼先生早餐吃剩的酥饼呢。
"Come, pig!" said Mr. Zuckerman, tapping the pail. "Come pig!" Wilbur took a step toward the pail.	“来呀，小猪！”祖克曼先生说着，敲了敲食桶。“来呀，小猪！”威伯朝那只桶走了一步。
"No-no-no!" said the goose. "It's the old pail trick, Wilbur. Don't fall for it, don't fall for it! He's trying to lure you back into captivity-ivity. He's appealing to your stomach."	“不——不——不！”母鹅说。“这桶是个并不新鲜的骗局，威伯。别上套儿！别上套儿！他是想以此诱捕你。他正在用好吃的诱惑你的肚子。”
Wilbur didn't care. The food smelled appetizing. He took another step toward the pail.	威伯不在乎。这食物闻起来太开胃了。他又朝食桶走了一步。
"Pig, pig!" said Mr. Zuckerman in a kind voice, and began walking slowly toward the barnyard, looking all about him innocently, as if he didn't know that a little white pig was following along behind him.	“小猪，小猪！”祖克曼先生甜蜜地叫着，开始慢慢地往谷仓方向走，同时弄出一副纯真的表情回头看着，好像他不知道这头小白猪正跟在他后面走一样。
"You'll miss your freedom," honked the goose. "An hour of freedom is worth a barrel of slops."	“你会失去你的自由的，”母鹅大喊。“一小时的自由要比一大桶猪食更可贵！”
When Mr. Zuckerman reached the pigpen, he climbed over the fence and poured the slops into the trough. Then he pulled the loose board away from the fence, so that there was a wide hole for Wilbur to walk through.	祖克曼先生走到猪圈附近，便爬过栅栏，把猪食倒进了猪食槽。然后他把那块松动的木板从栅栏上全拽下来，好让威伯能很容易的进去。
Wilbur paid no attention. He stepped through the fence into his yard. He walked to the trough and took a long drink of slops, sucking in the milk hungrily and chewing the popover. It was good to be home again.	威伯什么别的也没想。他一步步走进栅栏，到了他的院子里。他走向食槽，吸食了半天，大口大口地喝着牛奶，嚼着酥饼。能再回家真是太好了。
While Wilbur ate, Lurvy fetched a hammer and some 8-penny nails and nailed the board in place. Then he and Mr. Zuckerman leaned lazily on the fence and Mr. Zuckerman scratched Wilbur's back with a stick.	就在威伯饱餐之际，鲁维取了把锤子和一些八分长的钉子来，把那块板子钉了回去。然后，他和祖克曼先生懒洋洋地倚在栅栏旁。祖克曼先生用一根柴枝搔着威伯的后背。
"Yes, he'll make a good pig," said Mr. Zuckerman.	“是的，他会成为一头好猪的，”祖克曼先生说。
Wilbur heard the words of praise. He felt the warm milk inside his stomach. He felt the pleasant rubbing of the stick along his itchy back. He felt peaceful and happy and sleepy. This had been a tiring afternoon. It was still only about four o'clock but Wilbur was ready for bed.	威伯听到了对他的赞扬。他感到肚子里的牛奶暖暖的。他也很愿意在那根柴枝上蹭痒。他既幸福又满足，想去睡一觉了。这真是一个令人疲倦的下午。虽然此刻只不过才四点钟，威伯却准备上床就寝了。
"I'm really too young to go out into the world alone," he thought as he lay down.	“我真的太年轻，还不适合一个人在这世上闯，”躺下时他这么想。
When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth. I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters. And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it. Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide. All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet.	当人们想要说得俏皮些的时候，说话就可能会不大实在。在给你们讲点灯人的时候，我就不那么忠实，很可能给不了解我们这个星球的人们造成一个错误的概念。在地球上，人们所占的位置非常小。如果住在地球上的二十亿居民全站着，并且像开大会一样靠得紧些，那么就可以从容地站在一个二十海里见方的广场上。也就是说可以把整个人类集中在太平洋中一个最小的岛屿上。
The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that. They imagine that they fill a great deal of space. They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs. You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations. They adore figures, and that will please them. But do not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You have, I know, confidence in me.	当然，大人们是不会相信你们的。他们自以为要占很大地方，他们把自己看得象猴面包树那样大得了不起。你们可以建议他们计算一下。这样会使他们很高兴，因为他们非常喜欢数字。可是你们无须浪费时间去做这种乏味的连篇累牍的演算。这没有必要。你们可以完全相信我。
When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, flashed across the sand.	小王子到了地球上感到非常奇怪，他一个人也没有看到，他正担心自己跑错了星球。这时，在沙地上有一个月光色的圆环在蠕动。
"This is the desert. There are no people in the desert. The Earth is large," said the snake.	“这里是沙漠，沙漠中没有人。地球是很大的。”蛇说。
The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky.	小王子坐在一块石头上，抬眼望着天空，说道：
"I wonder," he said, "whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again… Look at my planet. It is right there above us. But how far away it is!"	“我捉摸这些星星闪闪发亮是否为了让每个人将来有一天都能重新找到自己的星球。看，我那颗行星。它恰好在我们头顶上……可是，它离我们好远哟！”
"It is beautiful," the snake said. "What has brought you here?"	“它很美。”蛇说，“你到这里来干什么呢?”
"Where are the men?" the little prince at last took up the conversation again. "It is a little lonely in the desert…"	“人在什么地方?”小王子终于又开了腔。“在沙漠上，真有点孤独……”
"You are a funny animal," he said at last. "You are no thicker than a finger…"	“你是个奇怪的动物，细得象个手指头……。”小王子终于说道。
"But I am more powerful than the finger of a king," said the snake.	“但我比一个国王的手指更有威力。”蛇说道。
"You are not very powerful. You haven't even any feet. You cannot even travel…"	“你并不那么有威力……你连脚都没有……你甚至都不能旅行……”
"I can carry you farther than any ship could take you," said the snake.	“我可以把你带到很远的地方去，比一只船能去的地方还要远。”蛇说道。
He twined himself around the little prince's ankle, like a golden bracelet.	蛇就盘结在小王子的脚腕子上，象一只金镯子。
"Whomever I touch, I send back to the earth from whence he came," the snake spoke again. "But you are innocent and true, and you come from a star…"	“被我碰触的人，我就把他送回老家去。”蛇还说，“可是你是纯洁的，而且是从另一个星球上来的……”
"You move me to pity-- you are so weak on this Earth made of granite," the snake said. "I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet. I can--"	“在这个花岗石的地球上，你这么弱小，我很可怜你。如果你非常怀念你的星球，那时我可以帮助你。我可以———”
"Oh! I understand you very well," said the little prince. "But why do you always speak in riddles?"	“啊！我很明白你的意思。”小王子说，“但是你为什么说话总是像让人猜谜语似的?”
The barn was very large. It was very old. It smelled of hay and it smelled of manure. It smelled of the perspiration of tired horses and the wonderful sweet breath of patient cows. It often had a sort of peaceful smell -- as though noghing bad could happen ever again in the world. It smelled of grain and of harness dressing and of axle grease and of rubber boots and of new rope. And whenever the cat was given a fish-head to eat, the barn would smell of fish. But mostly it smelled of hay, for there was always hay in the great loft up overhead. And there was always hay being pitched down to the cows and the hourses and the sheep.	谷仓很大，也很旧。里面全是干草和粪肥的气味。还有种跑累了的马身上的汗味儿与好脾气的母牛喷出的奇妙的香甜味道。空气中常驻的，是一种和平的气息——好像这个世界上再不会有坏事情发生了。这里偶尔还会有谷粒的香味，马具上的草料味，车子上的润滑油味，橡胶靴子味，或是新扎的草绳味儿。如果猫儿叼着人们扔给他的鱼头到这里来享受时，谷仓里就会多了股鱼腥味儿。不过，这里面最浓的味道却是干草味儿，因为谷仓上面的大阁楼里总是堆满了干草。这些干草被不断地扔给下面的母牛、马、绵羊们吃。
The barn was pleasantly warm in winter when the animals spent most of their time indoors, and it was pleasantly cool in summer when the big doors stood wide open to the breeze. The barn had stalls on the main floor for the work hourses, tie-ups on the main floor for the cows, a sheepfold down below for the sheep, a pigpen down below for Wilbur, and it was full of all sorts of things that you find in barns: ladders, grindsones, pitch forks, monkey wrenches, scythes, lawn mowers, snow shovels, ax handles, milk pails, water buchers, empty grain sacks, and rusty rat traps. It was the kind of barn that swallows like to build their nests in. It was the kind of barn that children like to play in. And the whole thing was owned by Fern's uncle, Mr. Homer L. Zuckerman.	冬天，当动物们在外面呆久了，回来后会觉得这个谷仓格外的温暖；而夏天呢，当谷仓的门大大敞开着，微风吹进来，这里又变得说不出的凉爽。谷仓上层面有马厩、牛棚，下层的地窖里是羊圈、威伯住的猪圈；里面还堆着你能从谷仓里找到的各类的器具：梯子，磨石，长柄草叉，活手搬子，大号的镰刀，割草机，清雪铲，斧子柄儿，牛奶桶，水桶，空粮食袋子，生锈的捕鼠夹等等。这是燕子们喜欢来筑巢的谷仓。这里的一切都是属于芬的舅舅，霍默·L·祖克曼先生的。
Wilbur's new home was in the lower part of the barn, directly underneath the cows. Mr. Zuckerman knew that a manure pile is a good place to keep a young pig. Pigs need warmth, and it was warm and comfortable down there in the barn cellar on the south side.	威伯的新家在谷仓的下层，正好在牛棚底下。祖克曼先生知道牛粪堆是养小猪的好地方。猪喜欢温暖，而谷仓下朝南的地窖正是温暖而又舒适的地方。
Fern came almost every day to visit him. She found an old milking stool that had been discarded, and she placed the stool in the sheepfold next to Wilbur's pen. Here she sat quietly during the long afternoons, thinking and listening and watching Wilbur. The sheep soon got to know her and trust her. So did the geese, who lived with the sheep. All the animals trusted her, she was so quiet and friendly. Mr. Zuckerman did not allow her to take Wilbur out, and he did not allow to get into the pigpen. But he told Fern that she could sit on the stool and watch Wilbur as long as she wanted to. It made her happy just to be near the pig, and it made her happy just to be near the pig, and it made Wilbur happy to know that she was sitting there, right outside his pen. But he never had any fun--no walks, no redes, no swims.	芬差不多每天都来看威伯。她找到一张没人要的挤奶凳，于是便把凳子搬到紧挨着威伯的猪圈的羊圈旁。整个漫长的下午，她就这么静静地坐在那里，望着威伯，想着，听着。绵羊不久便认识她，并信任她了。和羊住在一起的母鹅也是。所有的动物都信任她，因为她是那么的文静、和善。祖克曼先生不让她把威伯带出去，也不让她进猪圈。不过，他告诉芬，如果她愿意，她坐在凳子上看威伯多久都行。能靠近威伯她就感到很幸福了；知道芬就坐在他家的外面，威伯也感到无比的快活。只是他却再不能做从前的乐事了——不能再散步，不能再坐婴儿车，也不能再去游泳了。
One afternoon in June, when Wilbur was almost two months old, he wandered out into his small yard outside the barn. Fern had not arrived for her usual visit. Wilbur stood in the sun feeling lonely and bored.	六月的一个下午，差不多两个月大的威伯游荡到他在谷仓外的院子里。那天芬没像往常一样来看他。站在阳光下的威伯，觉得孤单而又无聊。
"There's never anything to do around here," he thought. He walked slowly to his food trough and sniffed to see if anything had been overlooked at lunch. He found a small strip of potato skin and ate it. His back itched, so he leaned against the fence and rubbed against the boards. When he tired of this, he walked indoors, climbed to the top of the manured pile, and sat down. He didn't feel like going to sleep, he didn't feel like digging, he was tired of standing still, tired of lying down. "I'm less than two months old and I'm tired of living," he said. He walked out to the yard again.	“在这里从没任何事儿可做，”他想。他慢慢地走到食槽前，用鼻子搜寻着，想找找是否有忘了吃的午餐。他发现了一小截土豆皮，就把它吃了下去。他感到背有点儿痒，就斜靠到栅栏上，在木板上使劲的蹭着。当他蹭腻了，便走回他的家门口，爬到牛粪堆顶上，坐了下来。他不想睡，也不想再乱拱了，他厌倦了再这么静静的傻站着，也厌倦了睡觉。“我才活了不到两个月，就对生活厌烦了，”他说。他又往院子里去了。
"When I'm out here," he said, "there's no place to go but in. When I'm indoors, there's no place to go but out in the yard."	“当我来到这儿，”他说，“除了回家没别的地方可去。当我进了家，除了院子也没别的地方可逛。”
"That's where you're wrong, my friend, my freiend," said a voice. 	“你错了，我的朋友，我的朋友。”一个声音说。
Wilbur looked through the fence and saw the goose standing there.	威伯往栅栏那边看去，发现一只鹅就站在那里。
"You don't have to stay in that dirty-llittle dirty-little dirty-little yard," said the goose, who talded rather fast. "One of the boards is loose. Push on it, push-push-push on it, and come on out!"	“你不用老呆在那个肮脏的-小 肮脏的-小 肮脏的-小院子里，”母鹅说得相当的快。“这儿有一块木板松了。推开它，推-推-推开它，就能够出去！”
"At-at-at, at the risk of repeating myself," said the goose, "I suggest that you come on out. It's wonderful out here."	“让-让-让，让我冒险重复一遍，”母鹅说，“我的意思是，建议你跑出去。这外面的世界精彩极了。”
Wilbur walked up to the fence and saw that the goose was right--one board was loose. He put his head sown, shut his eyes, and pushed. The board gave way. In a minute he had squeezed through the fence and was standing in the long grass outside his yard. The goose chuckled.	威伯走到栅栏旁，发现母鹅说得对——真的有一块木板松了。他低下头，闭起眼，用力撞过去。木板松开了。没用一分钟，他就挤过了栅栏，来到院子外的长草丛中了。母鹅嘎嘎大笑起来。
"I like it ," said Wilbur. "That is, I guess I like it." 	“我喜欢，”威伯说。“我的意思是说，我想我喜欢这感觉。”
Actually, Wilbur felt queer to be outside his fence, with nothing between him and the big world.	实际上，当威伯站在栅栏外，望着这个与自己毫无阻隔的大大的世界的时候，他只有种梦幻般的，说不清的感觉。
"Anywhere you like, anywhere you like," said the goose. "Go down through the orchard, root up the sod! Go down through the garden, dig up the radishes! Root up everything! Eat grass! Look for corn! Look for oats! Run all over! Skip and dance, jump and prance! Go down through the orchard and stroll in the woods! The world is a wonderful place when you're young."	“你喜欢的任何地方，你喜欢的任何地方，”母鹅说。“到果园那里去，把路上的草皮翻出来！到花园去，把萝卜拱出来！拱开一切！吃草！找玉米粒儿！寻找燕麦！把一切都压倒！蹦高和跳舞，后脚立地跳起来！走过果园，去树林里漫步！在你年轻时世界是多么美妙。”
The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count, there 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men-- that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.	地球可不是一颗普通的行星！它上面有一百一十一个国王（当然，没有漏掉黑人国王），七千个地理学家，九十万个实业家，七百五十万个酒鬼，三亿一千一百万个爱虚荣的人，也就是说，大约有二十亿的大人。
To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lamps.	为了使你们对地球的大小有一个概念，我想要告诉你们：在发明电之前，在六个大洲上，为了点路灯，需要维持一支为数四十六万二千五百一十一人的真正大军。
Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid spectacle. The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep. Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings. After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe, then those of South America; then those of South America; then those of North America. And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage. It would be magnificent.	从稍远的地方看过去，它给人以一种壮丽辉煌的印象。这支军队的行动就像歌剧院的芭蕾舞动作一样，那么有条不紊。首先出现的是新西兰和澳大利亚的点灯人。点着了灯，随后他们就去睡觉了。于是就轮到中国和西伯利亚的点灯人走上舞台。随后，他们也藏到幕布后面去了。于是就又轮到俄罗斯和印度的点灯人了。然后就是非洲和欧洲的。接着是南美的，再就是北美的。他们从来也不会搞错他们上场的次序。真了不起。
Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole-- only these two would live free from toil and care: they would be busy twice a year.	北极仅有一盏路灯，南极也只有一盏；唯独北极的点灯人和他南极的同行，过着闲逸、懒散的生活：他们每年只工作两次。
Fern loved Wilbur more than anything. She loved to stroke him, to feed him, to put him to bed. Every morning, as soon as she got up, she warmed his milk, tied his bib on, and held the bottle for him. Every afternoon, when the school bus stopped in front of her house, she jumped out and ran to the kitchen to fix another bottle for him. She fed him again at suppertime, and again just before going to bed. Mrs. Arable gave him a feeding around noontime each day, when Fern was away in school. Wilbur loved his milk, and he was never happier than when Fern was warming up a bottle for him. He would stand and gaze up at her with adoring eyes.	芬爱威伯胜过了一切。她喜欢抚摩着他，喂他，抱他上床睡觉。每天早晨，只要她一起床，就亲自给他热牛奶，再为他系上围嘴儿，为他拿着瓶子。每天下午，当校车停到她家门前，她就会跳下车，跑到厨房为他准备另一瓶牛奶。晚饭时她还要一遍遍地喂他，直到上床就寝前为止。每天下午，芬刚离开学校的时候，阿拉贝尔太太就替芬喂威伯。威伯虽然喜欢喝奶，但只有芬为他热奶时，他才感到莫大的幸福，这时他会站起来，用充满深情的眼睛注视着她。
For the first few days of his life, Wilbur was allowed to live in a box near the stove in the kitchen. Then when Mrs. Arable complained, he was moved to a bigger box in the woodshed. At two weeks of age, he was moved outdoors. It was apple-blossom time, and the days were getting warmer. Mr. Arable fixed a small yard specially for Wilbur under an apple tree, and gave him a large wooden box full of straw, with a doorway cut in it so he could walk in and out as he pleased.	在威伯出生后的最初数天里，他被允许住在厨房火炉旁的盒子里。可后来，阿拉贝尔太太开始抱怨说，他该搬到柴棚那儿的大一点的房子里去住。因此在两周大的时候，他被挪到了户外。已经快到苹果树开花的时候了，天气正在变暖。阿拉贝尔先生在苹果树下为威伯特别圈了一座小院子，在里面给他搭了一个铺满稻草的大房子，房子底下还留出一个小门，如果他高兴，他可以随时从中进出。
"No," said her father. "Your watch and see what he does."	“不会的，”她的父亲说，“你只要看他都在做什么就知道了。”
Carrying a bottle of milk, Fern sat down under the apple tree inside the yard. Wilbur ran to her and she held the bottle for him while he sucked. When he had finished the last drop, he grunted and walked sleepily into the box. Fern peered through the door. Wilbur was poking the straw with his snout. In a short time he had dug a tunnel in the straw. He crawled into the tunnel and disappeared from sight, completely covered with straw. Fern was enchanted. It relieved her mind to know that her baby would sleep covered up, and would stay warm.	芬拿了一瓶牛奶，坐到小院子里的苹果树下。威伯立刻朝她跑过来，她握住奶瓶喂他喝。吸吮完最后一滴后，威伯打着满意的呼噜，睡意朦胧地踱进小房子里去了。芬趴在房门口往里窥视。见威伯正用他的鼻子拱那些稻草。只一小会儿，他就在稻草间掘出了一个坑。他爬进坑里，完全被稻草盖住了，就此从芬的视线里消失。芬简直看入迷了。她这才放了心，因为她知道她的宝宝睡得既舒服又暖和。
Every morning after breakfast, Wilbur walked out to the road with Fern and waited with her till the bus came. She would wave good-bye to him, and he would stand and watch the bus until it vanished around a turn. While Fern was in school, Wilbur was shut up inside his yard. But as soon as she got home in the afternoon, she would take him out and he would follow her around the place. If she went into the house, Wilbur went, too. If she went upstairs, Wilbur would wait at the bottom step until she came down again. If she took her doll for a walk in the doll carriage, Wilbur followed along. Sometimes, on these journeys, Wilbur would get tired, and Fern would pick him up and put him in the carriage alongside the doll. He liked this. And if he was very tired, he would close his eyes and go to sleep under the doll's blanket. He looked cute when his eyes were closed, because his lashes were so long. The doll would close her eyes, too, and Fern would wheel the carriage very slowly and smoothly so as not to wake her infants.	每天早饭后，威伯都和芬一起走到路上，直到校车开来。等她挥手和他说完再见，他便站在那里望着汽车，直到车拐个弯儿开远。当芬上学时，威伯就被关到他的院子里。但只要下午芬一回来，她就会把他领出来，他便跟着她到处溜达。如果她进屋，威伯便也跟着往里走；如果她上了楼，威伯便在台阶上等着，直到她再次走下来；如果她用婴儿车带着自己的玩具娃娃去散步，威伯也会在后面跟着。有时，威伯有点儿走累了，芬就把他抱起来，放到车里的娃娃边上。他很喜欢这样。如果他非常的累，他就闭上眼睛，在娃娃身上蒙着的毯子下进入梦乡。他闭着眼的时候看起来格外的酷，因为他的眼毛是那么的长。娃娃也会闭眼睛呢。这时芬就会慢慢的、稳稳的推着小车，以免把她的宝宝们从梦中摇醒。
One warm afternoon, Fern and Avery put on bathing suits and went down to the brook for a swim. Wilbur tagged along at Fern's heels. When she waded into the brook, Wilbur waded in with her. He found the water quite cold--too cold for his liking. So while the children swam and played and splashed water at each other, Wilbur amused himself in the mud along the edge of the brook, where it was warm and moist and delightfully sticky and oozy.	一个温暖的下午，芬和埃弗里穿上他们的游泳衣去小河边游泳。威伯也紧紧在芬的脚后跟着，和她一齐涉进水里。可他感觉水很凉——凉得让他非常不喜欢。所以当孩子们开始游泳并互相撩水玩儿时，威伯就在河边的泥地上玩，那里又暖又湿，让他很开心。
Wilbur was what farmers call a spring pig, which simply means that he was born in springtime. When he was five weeks old, Mr. Arable said he was now big enough to sell, and would have to be sold. Fern broke down and wept. But her father was firm about it. Wilbur's appetite had increased; he was beginning to eat scraps of food in addition to milk. Mr. Arable was not willing to provide for him any longer. He had already sold Wilbur's ten brothers and sisters.	因为生在春天，所以威伯是头农夫们所谓的“春猪”。当他有五星期大时，阿拉贝尔先生说，他现在大得可以出卖了，因此应该被卖掉。芬听后，放声大哭起来。但她的父亲却还是坚持要卖威伯。威伯的食量变大了，除了牛奶他也开始吃散碎的食物了，阿拉贝尔先生不愿意再养他。他已经卖掉了威伯的十个哥哥姐姐了。
"He's got to go, Fern," he said. "You have had your fun raising a baby pig, but Wilbur is not a baby any longer and he has got to be sold."	“他必须得走，芬，”他说，“你已经体验到了养小猪的乐趣了，可威伯不再是小猪了，得被卖掉才行。”
"Call up the Zuckermans," suggested Mrs. Arable to Fern. "Your Uncle Homer sometimes raises a pig. And if Wilbur goes there to live, you can walk down the road and visit him as often as you like."	“给祖克曼舅舅打个电话，”阿拉贝尔太太对芬建议，“你霍默舅舅也养过猪。如果威伯卖到他那里，你就能顺着小路去看威伯了——只要你愿意的话。”
"How much money should I ask for him?" Fern wanted to know.	“我该向他要多少钱呢？”芬很想知道这一点。
"Well," said her father, "he's a runt. Tell your Uncle Homer you've got a pig you'll sell for six dollars, and see what he says."	“该要多少呢，”她的父亲说，“他长得这么瘦。告诉你霍默舅舅，你有一头小猪，只卖他六美元，看他有什么意见。”
It was soon arranged. Fern phoned and got her Aunt Edith, and her Aunt Edith hollered for Uncle Homer, and Uncle Homer came in from the barn and talked to Fern. When he heard that the price was only six dollars, he said he would buy the pig. Next day Wilbur was taken from his home under the apple tree and went to live in a manure pile in the cellar of Zuchkerman's barn.	这事一会儿就办妥了。伊迪丝舅妈听到芬打来的电话，便大声地叫在谷仓干活的霍默舅舅来听。当他听说小猪只卖六美元时，便说他决定买下了。第二天，威伯被从他在苹果树下的小房子里带走，住进了祖克曼先生的谷仓下面，地窖里的牛粪堆旁。
The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one. It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books.	第六颗行星则要大十倍。上面住着一位老先生，他在写作大部头的书。
"Oh, look! Here is an explorer!" he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming.	“瞧！来了一位探险家。”老先生看到小王子时，叫了起来。
The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little. He had already traveled so much and so far!	小王子在桌旁坐下，有点气喘吁吁。他跑了多少路啊！
"What is that big book?" said the little prince. "What are you doing?"	“这一大本是什么书？你在这里干什么？”小王子问道。
"A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts."	“地理学家，就是一种学者，他知道哪里有海洋，哪里有江河、城市、山脉、沙漠。”
"That is very interesting," said the little prince. "Here at last is a man who has a real profession！" And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer. It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen.	“这倒挺有意思。”小王子说。“这才是一种真正的行当。”他朝四周围看了看这位地理学家的星球。他还从来没有见过一颗如此壮观的行星。
"Ah！" The little prince was disappointed. "Has it any mountains?"	“啊！”小王子大失所望。“那么，山脉呢？”
"Exactly," the geographer said. "But I am not an explorer. I haven't a single explorer on my planet. It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts. The geographer is much too important to go loafing about. He does not leave his desk. But he receives the explorers in his study. He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels. And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer's moral character."	“一点不错，”地理学家说，“但是我不是探察家。我手下一个探察家都没有。地理学家是不去计算城市、河流、山脉、海洋、沙漠的。地理学家很重要，不能到处跑。他不能离开他的办公室。但他可以在办公室里接见探察家。他询问探察家，把他们的回忆记录下来。如果他认为其中有个探察家的回忆是有意思的，那么地理学家就对这个探察家的品德做一番调查。”
"Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer. So would an explorer who drank too much."	“因为一个说假话的探察家会给地理书带来灾难性的后果。同样，一个太爱喝酒的探察家也是如此。”
"Because intoxicated men see double. Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one."	“因为喝醉了酒的人把一个看成两个，那么，地理学家就会把只有一座山的地方写成两座山。”
"I know some one," said the little prince, "who would make a bad explorer."	“我认识一个人，他要是搞探察的话，就很可能是个不好的探察员。”小王子说。
"That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery."	“这是可能的。因此，如果探察家的品德不错，就对他的发现进行调查。”
"No. That would be too complicated. But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs. For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it."	“不。那太复杂了。但是要求探察家提出证据来。例如，假使他发现了一座大山，就要求他带来一些大石头。”
"But you-- you come from far away! You are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me!"	“正好，你是从老远来的么！你是个探察家！你来给我介绍一下你的星球吧！”
And, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil. The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil. One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink.	于是，已经打开登记簿的地理学家，削起他的铅笔来。他首先是用铅笔记下探察家的叙述，等到探察家提出了证据以后再用墨水笔记下来。
"Oh, where I live," said the little prince, "it is not very interesting. It is all so small. I have three volcanoes. Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct. But one never knows."	“啊！我那里，”小王子说道，“没有多大意思，那儿很小。我有三座火山，两座是活的，一座是熄灭了的。但是也很难说。”
"Why is that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!"	“这是为什么？花是我那个星球上最美丽的东西！”
"Geographies," said the geographer, "are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters. We write of eternal things."	“地理学书籍是所有书中最严肃的书。”地理学家说道，“这类书是从不会过时的。很少会发生一座山变换了位置，很少会出现一个海洋干涸的现象。我们要写永恒的东西。”
"But extinct volcanoes may come to life again," the little prince interrupted. "What does that mean-- 'ephemeral'?"	“但是熄灭的火山也可能会再复苏的。”小王子打断了地理学家。“什么叫短暂？”
"Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us," said the geographer. "The thing that matters to us is the mountain. It does not change."	“火山是熄灭了的也好，苏醒的也好，这对我们这些人来讲都是一回事。” 地理学家说，“对我们来说，重要的是山。山是不会变换位置的。”
"But what does that mean-- 'ephemeral'?" repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it.	“但是，‘转瞬即逝’是什么意思？”小王子再三地问道。他一旦提出一个问题是从不放过的。
"My flower is ephemeral," the little prince said to himself, "and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!"	小王子自言自语地说：“我的花是短暂的，而且她只有四根刺来防御外侮！可我还把她独自留在家里！”
That was his first moment of regret. But he took courage once more.	这是他第一次产生了后悔，但他又重新振作起来：
"What place would you advise me to visit now?" he asked.	“您是否能建议我去看些什么？”小王子问道。
"The planet Earth," replied the geographer. "It has a good reputation."	“地球这颗行星，”地理学家回答他说，“它的名望很高。”
And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower.	于是小王子就走了，他一边走一边想着他的花。
"Where's Papa going with the ax?" said Fern to her mother as they were setting the table for breakfast.	“爸爸拿着斧子去哪儿了？”在他们收拾桌子准备吃早饭时，芬问她的母亲。
"Out to the hoghouse," replied Mrs. Arable. "Some pigs were born last night."	“去猪圈了，”阿拉贝尔太太回答。“昨晚生了几只小猪。”
"I don't see why he needs an ax," continued Fern, who was only eight. 	“我不明白他为什么需要一把斧子，”只有八岁的芬继续说。
"Well," said her mother, "one of the pigs is a runt. It's very small and weak, and it will never amount to anything. So your father has decided to do away with it."	“哦，”她的母亲说，“其中的一头是个小个子。它长得又小又弱，没有任何可留下来的价值了。所以你爸爸决定去消灭它。”
"Do away with it?" shrieked Fern. "You mean kill it? Just because it's smaller than the others?"	“消灭它？”芬尖叫。“你是说杀死它？就因为他比别人的个子小？”
Mrs. Arable put a pitcher of cream on the table. "Don't yell, Fern!" she said. "Your father is right. The pig would probably die anyway."	阿拉贝尔太太把一罐奶油放到桌上。“别嚷，芬！”她说。“你爸做的对。那头猪不论如何都会死的。”
Fern pushed a chair out of the way and ran outdoors. The grass was wet and the earth smelled of spring time. Fern's sneakers were sopping by the time she caught up with her father.	芬推开挡在面前的椅子就往门外跑。草地湿漉漉的，泥土里散发着春天的气息。等芬赶上她的爸爸时，她的运动胶鞋全都湿透了。
"Fern," he said gently, "you will have to learn to control yourself."	“芬，”他温柔的说，“你该学会自我控制。”
"Control myself?" yelled Fern. "This is a matter of life and death, and you talk about controlling myself." Tears ran down her cheeks and she took hold of the ax and tried to pull it out of her father's hand.	“自我控制？”芬哭叫道，“这可是一件生死大事！你却对我说什么自我控制！”泪水流到芬的面颊上。她抓住了斧头柄，想把它从父亲手中抢下来。
"Fern," said Mr. Arable, "I know more about raising a litter of pigs than you do. A weakling makes trouble. Now run along!"	“芬，”阿拉贝尔先生说，“养小猪的事我比你知道的多。一个体质差的小猪很难养活的。现在走开！”
"But it's unfair," cried Fern. "The pig couldn't help being born small, could it? If I had been very small at birth, would you have killed me?"	“可是这不公平，”芬哭叫着。“这头猪愿意让自己生下来就小吗，它愿意吗？如果我生下来时也很瘦小，你就会杀死我吗？”
Mr. Arable smiled. "Certainly not," he said, looking down at his daughter with love. "But this is different. A little girl is one thing, a little runty pig is another."	阿拉贝尔先生微笑了。“当然不会了，”他说着，低下头慈爱地望着女儿。“但这是不一样的。一个小女孩是一码事儿，一个小瘦猪是另一码事儿。”
"I see no difference," replied Fern, still hanging on to the ax. "This is the most terrible case of injustice I ever heard of."	“我看没什么不一样，”芬回答着，仍死抓着斧柄不放，“这是我曾经听到过的最恐怖的案件！”
A queer look came over John Arable's face. He seemed almost ready to cry himself.	约翰·阿拉贝尔先生的脸上出现了某种奇特的表情。他好像也要哭了。
"All right," he said." You go back to the house and I will bring the runt when I come in. I'll let you start it on a bottle, like a baby. Then you'll see what trouble a pig can be."	“好吧，”他说。“你先回家吧。等我回家，我会把那头小猪带回来。我将让你用奶瓶喂他，象喂婴儿一样。那时你就会明白一头小猪会多么麻烦了。”
When Mr. Arable returned to the house half an hour later, he carried a carton under his arm. Fern was upstairs changing her sneakers. The kitchen table was set for breakfast, and the room smelled of coffee, bacon, damp plaster, and wood smoke from the stove.	半小时后，阿拉贝尔先生胳膊下夹着一个纸板盒回了家。芬正在楼上换她的运动鞋。厨房的桌子上摆好了早餐，房间里都是咖啡，薰肉的香味，湿湿的灰泥味儿，还有从炉子里荡出来的柴火烟味儿。
"Put it on her chair!" said Mrs. Arable. Mr. Arable set the carton down at Fern's place. Then he walked to the sink and washed his hands and dried them on the roller towel.	“把它放到她的椅子上！”阿拉贝尔太太说。阿拉贝尔先生把纸板盒放到芬的位子上。然后他到洗手池洗了手，用池边滚筒上的毛巾把手擦干。
Fern came slowly down the stairs. Her eyes were red from crying. As she approached her chair, the carton wobbled, and there was ascratching noise. Fern looked at her father. Then she lifted the lid of the carton. There, inside, looking up at her, was the newborn pig. It was a white one. The morning light shone through its ears, turning them pink.	芬慢慢地下了楼。因为刚刚哭过，她的眼还是红红的。当她走近她的椅子，纸板盒开始晃动起来，里面传出了抓搔声。芬看了看她的父亲。然后她掀起了盒盖。从那里面打量着她的，正是那新生的小猪。它是白色的。早晨的阳光把它的耳朵映得粉红。
"He's yours," said Mr. Arable. "Saved from an untimely death. And may the good Lord forgive me for this foolishness."	“他是你的了，”阿拉贝尔先生说，“是你使他免于一死。愿上帝能原谅我这愚蠢的行为。”
Fern couldn't take her eyes off the tiny pig. "Oh," she whispered. "Oh, look at him! He's absolutely perfect."	芬不错眼珠地看着这头小小猪。“哦，”她轻声赞美，“哦，看他呀！他漂亮极了。”
She closed the carton carefully. First she kissed her father, then she kissed her mother. Then she opened the lid again, lifted the pig out, and held it against her cheek. At this moment her brother Avery came into the room. Avery was ten. He was heavily armed--an air rifle in one hand, a wooden dagger in the other.	她小心地关上了盖子。她先吻了爸爸，又吻了妈妈。然后她又揭开盖子，把小猪举起来，让他贴到自己的脸上。这时，她的哥哥埃弗里走了进来。埃弗里十岁了。他的身上可是全副武装呢——一只手里拿着气枪，一只手里攥着一把木制匕首。
"She's got a guest for breakfast," said Mrs. Arable. "Wash your hands and face, Avery!"	“她有了一位来吃早餐的客人，”阿拉贝尔太太说。“埃弗里，去洗手洗脸！”
"Let's see it!" said Avery, setting his gun down. "You call that miserable thing a pig? That's a fine specimen of a pig--it's no bigger than a white rat."	“让我看看它嘛！”埃弗里说着，放下他的枪。“你说这可怜的小东西是一头猪？这不过是一头猪的小型复制品而已——他还没有一只白老鼠大呢。”
"Wash up and eat your breakfast, Avery!" said his mother. "The school bus will be along in half an hour."	“去洗脸吃饭，埃弗里！”他的妈妈说。“半小时内校车就要来了。”
"No, I only distribute pigs to early risers," said Mr. Arable. "Fern was up at daylight, trying to rid world of injustice. As a result, she now has a pig. A small one, to be sure, but nevertheless a pig. It just shows what can happen if a person gets out of bed promptly. Let's eat!"	“不，我只把小猪送给早起的人，”阿拉贝尔先生说，“为了制止这世界上的不公正行为，芬天刚亮就起床了。结果，她现在有了一头小猪。当然了，他的确是特别小，可不管怎么说这都是一头小猪。这只是表明，如果一个人能迅速地从床上爬起来，会有什么样的事情发生。让我们开饭吧！”
But Fern couldn't eat until her pig had had a drink of milk. Mrs. Arable found a baby's nursing bottle and a rubber nipple. She poured warm milk into the bottle, fitted the nipple over the top, and handed it to Fern. "Give him his breakfast!" she said.	但是芬要等到她的小猪喝完牛奶后才肯吃饭。阿拉贝尔太太找出了一个婴儿用的奶瓶和奶嘴儿。她把温乎乎的牛奶倒进奶瓶里，又把奶嘴儿安上，才把奶瓶递给了芬。“给他吃早餐吧！”她说。
A minute later, Fern was seated on the floor in the corner of the kitchen with her infant between her knees, teaching it to suck from the bottle. The pig, although tiny, had a good appetite and caught on quickly.	一分钟后，芬坐在厨房角落里的地板上，把她的小宝贝抱在膝头，开始教他如何从瓶中喝奶。这小猪虽然那么小，却有一个好胃口，而且也学得很快。
"Run!" commanded Mrs. Arable, taking the pig from Fern and slipping a doughnut into her hand. Avery grabbed his gun and another doughnut.	“快跑！”阿拉贝尔太太命令着，把小猪从芬那里抱下来，将一张油煎圈饼放到她的手上。埃弗里赶忙抓起他的枪和另一张油煎圈饼。
The children ran out to the road and climbed into the bus. Fern took no notice of the others in the bus. She just sat and stared out of the window, thinking what a blissful world it was and how lucky she was to have entire charge of a pig. By the time the bus reached school, Fern had named her pet, selecting the most beautiful name she could think of.	孩子们跑到路边，上了校车。在车里，芬没有注意其他的人。她只是坐在那里朝车窗外看，想着这是个多美好的世界，自己又是多么幸运，居然可以拥有一头小猪。在车开到学校的那一刻，芬已经给她的宝贝起好了名字，选的是她能想到的最漂亮的名字。
She was still thinking about the pig when the teacher said: "Fern, what is the capital of Pennsylvania?"	当老师在课堂里问她：“芬，宾夕法尼亚洲的首府叫什么？”时，她还在想着那头小猪。
"Wilbur," replied Fern, dreamily. The pupils giggled. Fern blushed.	“威伯。”芬出神地回答。同学们格格地笑起来。芬脸红了。
The fifth planet was very strange. It was the smallest of all. There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter. The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no people, and not one house. But he said to himself, nevertheless:	第五颗行星非常奇怪，是这些星星中最小的一颗。行星上刚好能容得下一盏路灯和一个点路灯的人。小王子怎么也解释不通：这个坐落在天空某一角落，既没有房屋又没有居民的行星上，要一盏路灯和一个点灯的人做什么用。
"It may well be that this man is absurd. But he is not so absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler. For at least his work has some meaning. When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one flower. When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep. That is a beautiful occupation. And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful."	但他自己猜想：“可能这个人思想不正常。但他比起国王，比起那个爱虚荣的人，那个实业家和酒鬼，却要好些。至少他的工作还有点意义。当他点着了他的路灯时，就像他增添了一颗星星，或是一朵花。当他熄灭了路灯时，就像让星星或花朵睡着了似的。这差事真美妙，就是真正有用的了。”
When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter.	小王子一到了这个行星上，就很尊敬地向点路灯的人打招呼：
"Good morning. Why have you just put out your lamp?"	“早上好。——你刚才为什么把路灯灭了呢？”
"There is nothing to understand," said the lamplighter. "Orders are orders. Good morning."	“没什么要明白的。命令就是命令。”点灯的回答说。“早上好。”
"I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep."	“我干的是一种可怕的职业。以前还说得过去，早上熄灯，晚上点灯，剩下时间，白天我就休息，夜晚我就睡觉。”
"The orders have not been changed," said the lamplighter. "That is the tragedy! From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed!"	点灯的人说：“命令没有改，惨就惨在这里了！这颗行星一年比一年转得更快，而命令却没有改。”
"Then-- the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!"	“结果现在每分钟转一圈，我连一秒钟的休息时间都没有了。每分钟我就要点一次灯，熄一次灯！”
"It is not funny at all!" said the lamplighter. "While we have been talking together a month has gone by."	“一点趣味也没有，”点灯的说，“我们俩在一块说话就已经有一个月的时间了。”
As the little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders. He remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling up his chair; and he wanted to help his friend.	小王子瞅着他，他喜欢这个点灯人如此忠守命令。这时，他想起了他自己从前挪动椅子寻找日落的事。他很想帮助他的这位朋友。
"You know," he said, "I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to..."	“告诉你，我知道一种能使你休息的办法，你要什么时候休息都可以。”
For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time.	因为，一个人可以同时是忠实的，又是懒惰的。
"Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk-- and the day will last as long as you like."	“你的这颗行星这样小，你三步就可以绕它一圈。你只要慢慢地走，就可以一直在太阳的照耀下，你想休息的时候，你就这样走……那么，你要白天有多长它就有多长。”
"That doesn't do me much good," said the lamplighter. "The one thing I love in life is to sleep."	“这办法帮不了我多大忙，生活中我喜欢的就是睡觉。”点灯人说。
"That man," said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, "that man would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman. Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous. Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself."	小王子在他继续往前旅行的途中，自言自语地说道：“这个人一定会被其他那些人，国王呀，爱虚荣的呀，酒鬼呀，实业家呀，所瞧不起。可是唯有他不使我感到荒唐可笑。这可能是因为他所关心的是别的事，而不是他自己。”
"That man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend. But his planet is indeed too small. There is no room on it for two people..."	“本来这是我唯一可以和他交成朋友的人。可是他的星球确实太小了，住不下两个人……”
What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!	小王子没有勇气承认的是：他留恋这颗令人赞美的星星，特别是因为在那里每二十四小时就有一千四百四十次日落!
SIR: You never answer any questions; you never show the slightest interest in anything I do. You are probably the horridest one of all those horrid Trustees, and the reason you are educating me is, not because you care a bit about me, but from a sense of Duty.	先生，您从不回答任何问题，对我的所作所为没有表示出一点点兴趣。您可能是那些理事里最可恶的一个，您让我受教育，完全是出于一种道义和责任，而毫无半点关怀和爱意。
I don't know a single thing about you. I don't even know your name. It is very uninspiring writing to a Thing. I haven't a doubt but that you throw my letters into the waste-basket without reading them. Hereafter I shall write only about work.	我对您一无所知，甚至不知道您的名字；写信给“一个东西”没有丝毫的意义。我丝毫不怀疑您读都不读我的信，就将它们扔进废纸篓。今后，除了学业之外，我再也不写其他任何事情了。
My re-examinations in Latin and geometry came last week. I passed them both and am now free from conditions. 	我的几何学跟拉丁文上星期补考都通过了。我一点问题都没有就过关了。
Please forget about that dreadful letter I sent you last week-- I was feeling terribly lonely and miserable and sore-throaty the night I wrote. I didn't know it, but I was just sickening for tonsillitis and grippe and lots of things mixed. I'm in the infirmary now, and have been here for six days; this is the first time they would let me sit up and have a pen and paper. The head nurse is very bossy. But I've been thinking about it all the time and I shan't get well until you forgive me.	请原谅我上星期寄给您的那封蛮横无礼的信——写信那晚，我感觉到非常孤独，浑身不舒服，喉咙还隐隐作痛。现在我住进了大学病房已经6天了，今天他们第一次让我坐起来，还给我纸笔。护士长凶极了。我总是心神不安，也许得不到您的原谅，我永远都好不起来了。
Here is a picture of the way I look, with a bandage tied around my head in rabbit's ears.	这就是我现在的模样，绷带绕过我的头，绑了个大结，像兔子的耳朵。
Doesn't that arouse your sympathy? I am having sublingual gland swelling. And I've been studying physiology all the year without ever hearing of sublingual glands. How futile a thing is education!	这样您会有点同情吗？我的淋巴结肿了。学了一年的生理课都不知道淋巴结在哪里，教育是多么无用呀。
I can't write any more; I get rather shaky when I sit up too long. Please forgive me for being impertinent and ungrateful. I was badly brought up. 	我不能写了，坐久了感觉有点虚弱。请原谅我的粗鲁和忘恩负义。我从小就缺乏教养。
Yesterday evening just towards dark, when I was sitting up in bed looking out at the rain and feeling awfully bored with life in a great institution, the nurse appeared with a long white box addressed to me, and filled with the LOVELIEST pink rosebuds. And much nicer still, it contained a card with a very polite message written in a funny little uphill back hand (but one which shows a great deal of character). Thank you, Daddy, a thousand times. Your flowers make the first real, true present I ever received in my life. If you want to know what a baby I am I lay down and cried because I was so happy.	昨天傍晚，我坐在病床上，望着窗外的雨景，有一种强烈的感觉，觉得人生真是无聊烦恼透了。护士送了一个大的白色盒子给我，里面装满了鲜艳的玫瑰花。更令人愉快的是，上面还附有一张措辞优雅的便笺，一笔颇有性格的左斜体，一点点爬升上去。叔叔，谢谢您，一千个谢谢。您的花让我第一次感觉如此真实，在我生命中第一次如此清晰的呈现。我高兴极了，像个孩子似的，躺下来大哭一场。
Now that I am sure you read my letters, I'll make them much more interesting, so they'll be worth keeping in a safe with red tape around them--only please take out that dreadful one and burn it up. I'd hate to think that you ever read it over.	现在我确定您读了我的信了。我以后会写得更有趣些，这样才值得用红缎带扎起来放在保险柜里——不过请找出那封糟糕透顶的信烧掉它。真不愿意您再重新读起它。
Thank you for making a very sick, cross, miserable Freshman cheerful. Probably you have lots of loving family and friends, and you don't know what it feels like to be alone. But I do.	谢谢您使一个生病的，神经兮兮，又悲伤的新生高兴起来。也许您有很多亲爱的家人与朋友，无法明白孤独是什么样的滋味，可我的体会太深刻了。
Goodbye--I'll promise never to be horrid again, because now I know you're a real person; also I'll promise never to bother you with any more questions.	晚安。我保证以后决不再胡闹了，因为我现在知道您是一个活生生的真人，而且我也保证以后不再拿问题来烦您了。
Did you ever see this campus? (That is merely a rhetorical question. Don't let it annoy you.) It is a heavenly spot in May. All the shrubs are in blossom and the trees are the loveliest young green-- even the old pines look fresh and new. The grass is dotted with yellow dandelions and hundreds of girls in blue and white and pink dresses. Everybody is joyous and carefree, for vacation's coming, and with that to look forward to, examinations don't count.	您曾看到过我们的学校吗？（这只是一句客套话，请别在意。）5月时节，这里的景致美妙极了。灌木丛中花团烂漫，树枝上泛起一片青绿色——连最苍老的松树也焕然一新。草皮上点缀着黄色蒲公英，还有几百个穿着蓝的白的和粉红衣裳的女孩们。每个人都欢欣快乐，无忧无虑。因为假期即将来临，还有伴随而来令人期待的一切，考试的忧虑也就抛在九霄云外了。
Isn't that a happy frame of mind to be in? And oh, Daddy! I'm the happiest of all! Because I'm not in the asylum any more; and I'm not anybody's nursemaid or typewriter or bookkeeper (I should have been, you know, except for you).	真令人心旷神怡，而我，叔叔，是里面最快乐的一个！因为我再也不是在约翰•格利尔孤儿院了，不再是谁的保姆、打字员，或会计（可您知道，如果没有您，我只能是其中的一个）。
I'm going to be good and sweet and kind to everybody because I'm so happy. And this summer I'm going to write and write and write and begin to be a great author. Isn't that an exalted stand to take? Oh, I'm developing a beautiful character! It droops a bit under cold and frost, but it does grow fast when the sun shines.	我以后要听话、温柔、又善良地对待大家，因为我太快乐了。而这个夏天我要开始写作，开始成为一个伟大的作家。这还算不得一个崇高的目标吗？我在培养一种美好的气质！尽管寒冷和冰霜会使它低落下去，但灿烂的阳光又会使它迅速高涨起来。
That's the way with everybody. I don't agree with the theory that adversity and sorrow and disappointment develop moral strength. The happy people are the ones who are bubbling over with kindliness. I have no faith in misanthropes. (Fine word! Just learned it.) You are not a misanthrope are you, Daddy?	这是每个人的必由之路。我不相信所谓逆境、忧伤或失意会造就道德力量的理论。幸福的人才会热情洋溢。我也不相信厌世者（好字眼，刚刚学的）。长腿叔叔，您不是一个厌世者吧！
I started to tell you about the campus. I wish you'd come for a little visit and let me walk you about and say:	我一开始就告诉您学校风景。我希望您能来稍微参观一下，我可以陪您到处走走，告诉您：
'That is the library. This is the gas plant, Daddy dear. The Gothic building on your left is the gymnasium, and the Tudor Romanesque beside it is the new infirmary.'	“亲爱的叔叔，那是图书馆，这是煤气厂。您左手边的哥特式建筑物是体育馆，而它旁边都铎式建筑是新的医院。”
Oh, I'm fine at showing people about. I've done it all my life at the asylum, and I've been doing it all day here. I have honestly.	哦！我很会带人参观喔。过去在约翰•格利尔孤儿院，我常常带人参观。今天还领人走了一整天。真的，不骗您。
That's a great experience. I never talked to a man before (except occasional Trustees, and they don't count). Pardon, Daddy, I don't mean to hurt your feelings when I abuse Trustees. I don't consider that you really belong among them. You just tumbled on to the Board by chance. The Trustee, as such, is fat and pompous and benevolent. He pats one on the head and wears a gold watch chain.	真是一个不同寻常的经历。我从未跟男人说过话（除了个别理事，但他们不算），对不起，叔叔，当我那样谈理事们的时候，并不是故意要冒犯您。我并没有把您看着是他们中的一员。所谓理事，应当是肥胖、傲慢、一副慈善模样，喜欢摸人脑袋，还挂了一个金怀表。
That looks like a June bug, but is meant to be a portrait of any Trustee except you.	那样看起来像一只金甲虫，可这是除您以外的其他所有理事的画像。
I have been walking and talking and having tea with a man. And with a very superior man--with Mr. Jervis Pendleton of the House of Julia; her uncle, in short (in long, perhaps I ought to say; he's as tall as you.) Being in town on business, he decided to run out to the college and call on his niece. He's her father's youngest brother, but she doesn't know him very intimately. It seems he glanced at her when she was a baby, decided he didn't like her, and has never noticed her since.	我同一名男土散步、聊天、喝茶。他是一个很了不起的人物——茱莉亚家族的杰维•平莱顿先生。简单地说，是她叔叔（详细说来，我应该告诉您，他的身材和您一样高）。他到城里办事，顺便来学校里看看侄女。他是茱莉亚爸爸最小的弟弟，但茱莉亚和他并不亲密。好像在她的童年时代，他看了她一眼，没有太多的好感，就再也不关注她了。
Anyway, there he was, sitting in the reception room very proper with his hat and stick and gloves beside him; and Julia and Sallie with seventh-hour recitations that they couldn't cut. So Julia dashed into my room and begged me to walk him about the campus and then deliver him to her when the seventh hour was over. I said I would, obligingly but unenthusiastically, because I don't care much for Pendletons.	无论如何，他来了，端坐在接待室里，帽子、手杖、手套放在一边。莎莉和茱莉亚第7节是朗读课，不能缺席。所以茱莉亚冲进我的房间，求我陪他到处走走，等她上完第7堂课再领他去找她。出于礼貌，我勉强答应了，因为我对平莱顿家族没有多大的好感。
But he turned out to be a sweet lamb. He's a real human being-- not a Pendleton at all. We had a beautiful time; I've longed for an uncle ever since. Do you mind pretending you're my uncle? I believe they're superior to grandmothers.	不过他是一个温文尔雅、情感丰富的人——一点也不像平莱顿家族的人。我们度过了一段美好的时光，从那时起我就渴望有个叔叔。您来作我的叔叔好吗？我觉得叔叔比祖母还好。
Mr. Pendleton reminded me a little of you, Daddy, as you were twenty years ago. You see I know you intimately, even if we haven't ever met!	平莱顿先生让我想起您，叔叔，像20年前的您。您瞧，我对您多么熟悉，尽管我们还没有见面。
He's tall and thinnish with a dark face all over lines, and the funniest underneath smile that never quite comes through but just wrinkles up the corners of his mouth. And he has a way of making you feel right off as though you'd known him a long time. He's very companionable.	他高高瘦瘦，脸色黝黑，轮廓很深，虽然没有开怀大笑，只把嘴角一咧，就能让您觉得很舒服。尽管认识不久，却一见如故。
We walked all over the campus from the quadrangle to the athletic grounds; then he said he felt weak and must have some tea. He proposed that we go to College Inn--it's just off the campus by the pine walk. I said we ought to go back for Julia and Sallie, but he said he didn't like to have his nieces drink too much tea; it made them nervous. So we just ran away and had tea and muffins and marmalade and ice-cream and cake at a nice little table out on the balcony. 	我们走遍了中央广场到游乐场的每个角落。他说他走累了，要喝杯茶，提议我们去学院小吃店。小吃店不远，就在校门外的小路旁。我说该喊茱莉亚和莎莉一起去。他说他不愿自己的侄女喝茶太多，这会使她变得神经质。所以我们就径直去了，坐在走廊上一张雅致小桌子旁用茶、蛋糕、冰淇淋和饼干。
We had the jolliest time! But he had to run for his train the minute he got back and he barely saw Julia at all. She was furious with me for taking him off; it seems he's an unusually rich and desirable uncle. It relieved my mind to find he was rich, for the tea and things cost sixty cents apiece.	我们玩得很开心！可一回到学校，他就得去赶火车，只匆匆见了茱莉亚一面。茱莉亚对于我把他带出去很恼火。看来他是一位非比寻常的富有又值得人家羡慕的叔叔。知道了他很富有，让我感觉好过一些，因为茶和点心很贵，每样要6角钱呢。
This morning (it's Monday now) three boxes of chocolates came by express for Julia and Sallie and me. What do you think of that? To be getting candy from a man!	今天早上（今天是星期一）快递送来3盒巧克力，给茱莉亚、莎莉和我。您觉得如何？一个男人送来巧克力！
I wish you'd come and have tea some day and let me see if I like you. But wouldn't it be dreadful if I didn't? However, I know I should.	我希望您哪天来吃茶点，让我看看喜不喜欢您。可是如果我不喜欢，那岂不太糟糕了？不过，我相信自己应该要喜欢您的。
The fourth planet belonged to a businessman. This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince's arrival.	第四个行星是一个实业家的星球。这个人忙得不可开交，小王子到来的时候， 他甚至连头都没有抬一下。
"Three and two make five. Five and seven make twelve. Twelve and three make fifteen. Good morning. Fifteen and seven make twenty-two. Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight. I haven't time to light it again. Twenty-six and five make thirty-one. Phew! Then that makes five-hundred-and-one-million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one."	“三加二等于五。五加七等于十二。十二加三等于十五。早上好。十五加七， 二十二。二十二加六，二十八。没有时间去再点着它。二十六加五，三十一。哎哟！一共是五亿一百六十二万二千七百三十一。”
"Eh? Are you still there? Five-hundred-and-one million-- I can't stop… I have so much to do! I am concerned with matters of consequence. I don't amuse myself with balderdash. Two and five make seven…"	“嗯？你还待在这儿哪？五亿一百万……我也不知道是什么了。我的工作很多……我是很严肃的，我可是从来也没有功夫去闲聊！二加五得七……”
"Five-hundred-and-one million what?" repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it.	“五亿一百万什么呀？”小王子重复问道。一旦他提出了一个问题，是从来也不会放弃的。
"During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I have been disturbed only three times. The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where. He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition. The second time, eleven years ago, I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism. I don't get enough exercise. I have no time for loafing. The third time-- well, this is it! I was saying, then, five -hundred-and-one millions--"	“我住在这个星球上五十四年以来，只被打搅过三次。第一次是二十二年前，不知从哪里跑来了一只金龟子来打搅我。它发出一种可怕的噪音，使我在一笔帐目中出了四个差错。第二次，在十一年前，是风湿病发作，因为我缺乏锻炼所致。我没有工夫闲逛。我可是个严肃的人。现在……这是第三次！我计算的结果是五亿一百万……”
The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question.	这位实业家知道要想安宁是无望的了，就说道：
"Millions of those little objects," he said, "which one sometimes sees in the sky."	“几百万个小东西，这些小东西有时出现在天空中。”
"Oh, no. Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming. As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence. There is no time for idle dreaming in my life."	“不是，是金黄色的小东西，这些小东西叫那些懒汉们胡思乱想。我是个严肃的人。我没有时间胡思乱想。”
"Five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one. I am concerned with matters of consequence: I am accurate."	“五亿一百六十二万七百三十一颗星星。我是严肃的人，我是非常精确的。”
"Kings do not own, they reign over. It is a very different matter."	“国王并不占有，他们只是进行‘统治’。这不是一码事。”
"It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are ever discovered."	“富了就可以去买别的星星，如果有人发现了别的星星的话。”
"This man," the little prince said to himself, "reasons a little like my poor tippler."	小王子自言自语地说：“这个人想问题有点像那个酒鬼一样。”
"To whom do they belong?" the businessman retorted, peevishly.	“那么你说星星是谁的呀？”实业家不高兴地顶了小王子一句。
"Then they belong to me, because I was the first person to think of it."	“那么，它们就是我的，因为是我第一个想到了这件事情的。”
"Certainly. When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you get an idea before any one else, you take out a patent on it: it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them."	“那当然。如果你发现了一颗没有主人的钻石，那么这颗钻石就是属于你的。当你发现一个岛是没有主的，那么这个岛就是你的。当你首先想出了一个办法，你就去领一个专利证，这个办法就是属于你的。既然在我之前不曾有任何人想到要占有这些星星，那我就占有这些星星。”
"Yes, that is true," said the little prince. "And what do you do with them?"	“这倒也是。可是你用它们来干什么？”小王子说。
"I administer them," replied the businessman. "I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence."	“我经营管理这些星星。我一遍又一遍地计算它们的数目。这是一件困难的事。但我是一个严肃认真的人！”
"If I owned a silk scarf," he said, "I could put it around my neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me. But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven…"	“对我来说，如果我有一条围巾，我可以用它来围着我的脖子，并且能带走它。我有一朵花的话，我就可以摘下我的花，并且把它带走。可你却不能摘下这些星星呀……”
"That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key."	“这就是说，我把星星的数目写在一片小纸头上，然后把这片纸头锁在一个抽屉里。”
"It is entertaining," thought the little prince. "It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence."	小王子想道：“真好玩。这倒蛮有诗意，可是，并不算是了不起的正经事。”
On matters of consequence, the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grown-ups.	关于什么是正经事，小王子的看法与大人们的看法非常不同。他接着又说：
"I myself own a flower," he continued his conversation with the businessman, "which I water every day. I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is extinct; one never knows). It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them. But you are of no use to the stars…"	“我有一朵花，我每天都给她浇水。我还有三座火山，我每星期把它们全都打扫一遍。连死火山也打扫。谁知道它会不会再复活。我拥有火山和花，这对我的火山有益处，对我的花也有益处。但是你对星星并没有用处……”
The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away.	实业家张口结舌无言以对。于是小王子就走了。
"The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary," he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey.	在旅途中，小王子只是自言自语地说了一句：“这些大人们真是奇怪极了。”
Is it snowing where you are? All the world that I see from my tower is draped in white and the flakes are coming down as big as pop-corns. It's late afternoon--the sun is just setting (a cold yellow colour) behind some colder violet hills, and I am up in my window seat using the last light to write to you.	您那里下雪了吗？从我的小阁楼望去，大地茫茫的一片雪白，雪花如爆米花般纷纷扬扬飘落下来。此刻正是傍晚时分，太阳刚落到寒冷的紫色山头后面，我坐在高高的窗台上，在最后一点余辉中，写信给您。
Your five gold pieces were a surprise! I'm not used to receiving Christmas presents. You have already given me such lots of things--everything I have, you know--that I don't quite feel that I deserve extras. But I like them just the same. Do you want to know what I bought with my money?	意外地收到您寄来的5个金币！我还没有养成收圣诞礼物的习惯。您已经给我这么多东西了——我所拥有的一切，您知道的——我觉得自己已经拥有太多了。但是我还是很高兴。您想知道我用钱买了什么吗？
I. A silver watch in a leather case to wear on my wrist and get me to recitations in time.	一、一只皮表带的银手表，使我能够准时复习功课。
IV. A steamer rug. (My tower is cold.)	四、一条轮船上用的小毯子（我的小阁楼很冷）。
V. Five hundred sheets of yellow manuscript paper. (I'm going to commence being an author pretty soon.)	五、500张黄色稿纸（我很快就要开始写作了）。
VI. A dictionary of synonyms. (To enlarge the author's vocabulary.)	六、—本同义词字典（可以增加作家的词汇量）。
VII. (I don't much like to confess this last item, but I will.) A pair of silk stockings.	七、（我不太想告诉您最后一件，不过还是告诉您吧）一双丝袜。
It was a very low motive, if you must know it, that prompted the silk stockings. Julia Pendleton comes into my room to do geometry, and she sits cross-legged on the couch and wears silk stockings every night. But just wait--as soon as she gets back from vacation I shall go in and sit on her couch in my silk stockings. You see, Daddy, the miserable creature that I am but at least I'm honest; and you knew already, from my asylum record, that I wasn't perfect, didn't you?	如果您一定要知道的话，是个很浅薄的动机促使我去买丝袜的。茱利亚•平莱顿每晚到我的房间里来做几何题练习，她穿着丝袜，盘腿坐在我床上。不过等着好了，等她一放假回来，我就要走进去，穿着丝袜坐在她的床上。您瞧，叔叔，我真是坏坯子，不过，至少我很诚实，您早就从约翰•格利尔孤儿院的记录里知道我不是完美的了，不是吗？
To recapitulate (that's the way the English instructor begins every other sentence), I am very much obliged for my seven presents. I'm pretending to myself that they came in a box from my family in California. The watch is from father, the rug from mother, the hot water bottle from grandmother who is always worrying for fear I shall catch cold in this climate--and the yellow paper from my little brother Harry. My sister Isabel gave me the silk stockings, and Aunt Susan the Matthew Arnold poems; Uncle Harry (little Harry is named after him) gave me the dictionary. He wanted to send chocolates, but I insisted on synonyms.	总而言之（英语教师每句话都会带上这个词），我对您送的这7件礼物都心存感激。我假装它们是装在一个大箱子里，从加州的家里寄来的。爸爸送表，妈妈送毯子，祖母送热水袋——她老怕我在这种季节着凉——稿纸是弟弟哈里送的，妹妹伊莎贝尔送我长统袜，苏珊姨妈送诗集，哈里舅舅（小哈里与他同名）送词典。他本想送巧克力，可我坚持要同义词词典。
And now, shall I tell you about my vacation, or are you only interested in my education as such? I hope you appreciate the delicate shade of meaning in 'as such'. It is the latest addition to my vocabulary.	现在我该跟您谈谈我的假期了，或许您更关心的是我的学业本身。希望您能体会“本身”这一词的微妙含义，这是我掌握的最新词汇。
The girl from Texas is named Leonora Fenton. (Almost as funny as Jerusha, isn't it?) I like her, but not so much as Sallie McBride; I shall never like any one so much as Sallie--except you. I must always like you the best of all, because you're my whole family rolled into one. Leonora and I and two Sophomores have walked 'cross country every pleasant day and explored the whole neighbourhood, dressed in short skirts and knit jackets and caps, and carrying shiny sticks to whack things with. Once we walked into town--four miles-- and stopped at a restaurant where the college girls go for dinner. Broiled lobster (35 cents), and for dessert, buckwheat cakes and maple syrup (15 cents). Nourishing and cheap.	来自德州的女孩名叫蓝依拉•芬顿（这名字几乎和Jerusha一样可笑，不是吗？）。我喜欢她，不过比不上喜欢Sallie McBride，我可能不会喜欢其他人像我喜欢莎莉一样——除了您。我应该永远把您放在首位，因为您是我一大家子的化身。每当天气晴朗的日子，蓝侬拉跟我还有两个二年级的女孩子就散步到乡间，穿着短裙和针织外衣，戴上线缝的帽子，拿上光滑的棍子四下里敲敲打打。我们的足迹遍布四周。有一回我们走到4英里外的镇上，停在一家大学女孩子都在那里用餐的餐馆。要了红焖龙虾（35分），吃完后再吃煎饼和枫糖浆（15分）。老天啊，有营养，又便宜！
It was such a lark! Especially for me, because it was so awfully different from the asylum--I feel like an escaped convict every time I leave the campus. Before I thought, I started to tell the others what an experience I was having. The cat was almost out of the bag when I grabbed it by its tail and pulled it back. It's awfully hard for me not to tell everything I know. I'm a very confiding soul by nature; if I didn't have you to tell things to, I'd burst.	这可真有趣！尤其对我而言，因为这跟孤儿院太不一样了——每回我离开学校，总觉得好像逃狱的犯人。我不假思索就谈起我的感受，几乎说破了自己的秘密。我赶紧收住话题，守口如瓶真非易事。我天性诚实坦率，要不是有您来倾诉一番，我非憋死不可。
We had a molasses candy pull last Friday evening, given by the house matron of Fergussen to the left-behinds in the other halls. There were twenty-two of us altogether, Freshmen and Sophomores and juniors and Seniors all united in amicable accord. The kitchen is huge, with copper pots and kettles hanging in rows on the stone wall-- the littlest casserole among them about the size of a wash boiler. Four hundred girls live in Fergussen. The chef, in a white cap and apron, fetched out twenty-two other white caps and aprons-- I can't imagine where he got so many--and we all turned ourselves into cooks.	上星期五晚上我们吃麦芽糖，是由我们大楼的管理员提供的。还邀请了其他宿舍楼没有回家的同学参加。22名不同年级的同学友好地聚集在一起。厨房很宽敞，石头墙壁上挂着一排排铜锅铜壶，最小的双耳壶也和煮衣服的锅一般大小。费高森楼住了400名女生呢。头顶白帽，围着围裙的厨师又找出22套白围裙和白帽子——想不出来他从哪里弄来的——于是我们全把自己装扮成厨师。
It was great fun, though I have seen better candy. When it was finally finished, and ourselves and the kitchen and the door-knobs all thoroughly sticky, we organized a procession and still in our caps and aprons, each carrying a big fork or spoon or frying pan, we marched through the empty corridors to the officers' parlour, where half-a-dozen professors and instructors were passing a tranquil evening. We serenaded them with college songs and offered refreshments. They accepted politely but dubiously. We left them sucking chunks of molasses candy, sticky and speechless.	真的很有趣，虽然我吃过更好吃的麦芽糖。当一切终于结束时，我们每个人、整个厨房连同门板全都粘嗒嗒的，我们依然顶着白帽，围着围裙，每个人都带着一把大汤匙或平底锅，列队穿过空荡荡的大厅到了教师休息室，那里有半打的教授和讲师正在打发宁静的夜晚。我们为他们唱校歌，然后送上麦芽糖。他们彬彬有礼却又犹犹豫豫地接了下来。我们离开了，留下他们吃着大片的麦芽糖，粘嗒嗒而且好吃得说不出话来。
Don't you really think that I ought to be an artist instead of an author?	您真的不认为我应该当个艺术家，而不是作家？
Vacation will be over in two days and I shall be glad to see the girls again. My tower is just a trifle lonely; when nine people occupy a house that was built for four hundred, they do rattle around a bit.	再过两天假期就要结束，我又可以高兴地见到同学们了。我已经感到有些寂寞不安了。9个人住着400人的房子，确实有些坐立不安。
Eleven pages--poor Daddy, you must be tired! I meant this to be just a short little thank-you note--but when I get started I seem to have a ready pen.	可怜的叔叔，您一定累了！我本来打算要写封简短的感谢函——不过我一提起笔，就写了11页了。
Goodbye, and thank you for thinking of me--I should be perfectly happy except for one little threatening cloud on the horizon. Examinations come in February.	晚安，谢谢您会惦记着我——我本应该是无比快乐的，可惜心头有一小朵乌云笼罩着。2月份要考试了。
PS. Maybe it isn't proper to send love? If it isn't, please excuse. But I must love somebody and there's only you and Mrs. Lippett to choose between, so you see--you'll HAVE to put up with it, Daddy dear, because I can't love her.	又及：致上对您的爱意可能不太适当吧！如果这样，请您原谅。我总得爱个什么人吧，而可以选择的只有您和李皮太太，所以您瞧，您得忍耐—下，亲爱的叔叔，我实在无法爱她呀！
The next planet was inhabited by a tippler. This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection.	小王子所访问的下一个星球上住着一个酒鬼。访问时间非常短，可是它却使小王子非常忧伤。
"What are you doing there?" he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.	“你在干什么？”小王子问酒鬼，这个酒鬼默默地坐在那里，面前有一堆酒瓶子，有的装着酒，有的是空的。
"Forget what?" inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him.	小王子已经有些可怜酒鬼。他问道：“忘却什么呢？”
"Forget that I am ashamed," the tippler confessed, hanging his head.	酒鬼垂下脑袋坦白道：“为了忘却我的羞愧。”
"Ashamed of drinking!" The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence.	“我羞愧我喝酒。”酒鬼说完以后就再也不开口了。
"The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.	在旅途中，他自言自语地说道：“这些大人确实真叫怪。”
What do you think, Daddy? The English instructor said that my last paper shows an unusual amount of originality. She did, truly. Those were her words. It doesn't seem possible, does it, considering the eighteen years of training that I've had? The aim of the John Grier Home (as you doubtless know and heartily approve of) is to turn the ninety-seven orphans into ninety-seven twins.	叔叔，您猜怎么着？英文老师夸奖我上一篇作文别出心裁。她真的这么说！她就是这么讲的。想想我这18年来受的训练，这似乎不太可能，不是吗？约翰•格利尔孤儿院的目的，就是要把97个小孤儿变成97个相貌、言行举止都一样的人。
The unusual artistic ability which I exhibit was developed at an early age through drawing chalk pictures of Mrs. Lippett on the woodshed door.	我不寻常的艺术天分，倒是在很小时就在门板上画李皮太太培养出来的。
I hope that I don't hurt your feelings when I criticize the home of my youth? But you have the upper hand, you know, for if I become too impertinent, you can always stop payment of your cheques. That isn't a very polite thing to say--but you can't expect me to have any manners; a foundling asylum isn't a young ladies' finishing school.	我对小时候的家说长道短，希望您不要不高兴。不过您大权在握，如果我冒犯了您，您随时可以停止您的资助。这样说是不够礼貌，不过您不能期望我有什么教养，孤儿院毕竟不是淑女训练学校。
You know, Daddy, it isn't the work that is going to be hard in college. It's the play. Half the time I don't know what the girls are talking about; their jokes seem to relate to a past that every one but me has shared. I'm a foreigner in the world and I don't understand the language. It's a miserable feeling. I've had it all my life. At the high school the girls would stand in groups and just look at me. I was queer and different and everybody knew it. I could FEEL 'John Grier Home' written on my face. And then a few charitable ones would make a point of coming up and saying something polite. I HATED EVERY ONE OF THEM--the charitable ones most of all.	叔叔，您知道的，大学里难的不是功课，而是娱乐。很多时候，我都不懂女孩们在谈些什么，她们的玩笑似乎都与她们的过去联系在一起。这个过去人人有份，却与我无缘。我在她们的世界里就像是一个外国人，听不懂她们的语言。我很沮丧，我这一生浸透了沮丧。高中时，女孩们一群一伙的，冷眼相看。我很奇怪，与众不同，人人都知道这一点。我似乎感觉“约翰•格利尔孤儿院”就写在我脸上。然后会有一些好人走来安慰我。我恨他们每一个人——尤其是那些好人。
Nobody here knows that I was brought up in an asylum. I told Sallie McBride that my mother and father were dead, and that a kind old gentleman was sending me to college which is entirely true so far as it goes. I don't want you to think I am a coward, but I do want to be like the other girls, and that Dreadful Home looming over my childhood is the one great big difference. If I can turn my back on that and shut out the remembrance, I think, I might be just as desirable as any other girl. I don't believe there's any real, underneath difference, do you?	这里没有人知道我是孤儿院长大的。我告诉莎莉•麦克白我父母双亡，是一位好心的老先生送我上大学的——到目前为止，这都是事实。我不希望您觉得我很蠢，不过我真的希望跟其他女孩子一样，而那可怕的孤儿院的阴影却笼罩着我的童年，把我和大家隔绝开来。若能忘怀此事，把它逐出脑海，我想我应可以变得跟其他女孩一样可爱。我不认为自己和她们有什么真的区别。您说是吗？
I've just been reading this letter over and it sounds pretty un-cheerful. But can't you guess that I have a special topic due Monday morning and a review in geometry and a very sneezy cold?	我刚才又把信重读了一遍，调子似乎很低沉。但是，您可能猜不到，我星期一早上要交一篇特殊的作文，还要复习几何学，而且还得了感冒，不停地打喷嚏。
I forgot to post this yesterday, so I will add an indignant postscript. We had a bishop this morning, and WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAID?	昨天忘了发信，今天再发点牢骚。早上来了个主教，您猜他都说了些什么？
'The most beneficent promise made us in the Bible is this, "The poor ye have always with you." They were put here in order to keep us charitable.'	“圣经给我们的最佳许诺是‘常有穷人和你们同在’，他们可使我们永远以慈悲为怀。”
The poor, please observe, being a sort of useful domestic animal. If I hadn't grown into such a perfect lady, I should have gone up after service and told him what I thought.	您瞧，穷人成了有用的家畜，要不是我已经成了一位有教养的小姐，我本来会在礼拜结束后跑去告诉他我的想法。
I'm in the basket-ball team and you ought to see the bruise on my left shoulder. It's blue and mahogany with little streaks of orange. Julia Pendleton tried for the team, but she didn't get in. Hooray!	我已经入选篮球队了，您真该看看我左肩上的“成绩”，又青又紫的，绕着一圈紫色的边。茱莉亚•平莱顿也报了名，不过没入选真棒！
College gets nicer and nicer. I like the girls and the teachers and the classes and the campus and the things to eat. We have ice-cream twice a week and we never have corn-meal mush.	大学越来越有趣了。我喜欢这些女孩们，喜欢老师，喜欢上课，喜欢校园，喜欢那些好吃的食物——每周吃两次的冰淇淋，从不吃孤儿院的玉米粥。
You only wanted to hear from me once a month, didn't you? And I've been peppering you with letters every few days! But I've been so excited about all these new adventures that I MUST talk to somebody; and you're the only one I know. Please excuse my exuberance; I'll settle pretty soon. If my letters bore you, you can always toss them into the wastebasket. I promise not to write another till the middle of November. 	您只要我一个月写一封信，不是吗？我却每隔几天就寄一封给您！我对这些新奇的经历是这么的兴奋，我一定要找个人倾诉，您是我惟一认识的人。请原谅我的兴奋吧，我很快就会安定下来的。如果嫌烦，就把它们丢到废纸篓里。我保证11月中旬以前不再写信就是了。
The area of the convex surface of the frustum of a regular pyramid is half the product of the sum of the perimeters of its bases by the altitude of either of its trapezoids.	正棱锥形体平截头凸面的面积等于底边总长和梯形一边的高度乘积的一半。
It doesn't sound true, but it is--I can prove it!	听起来似乎不对，实际非常正确，我还验算过呢！
You've never heard about my clothes, have you, Daddy? Six dresses, all new and beautiful and bought for me--not handed down from somebody bigger. Perhaps you don't realize what a climax that marks in the career of an orphan? You gave them to me, and I am very, very, VERY much obliged. It's a fine thing to be educated--but nothing compared to the dizzying experience of owning six new dresses. Miss Pritchard, who is on the visiting committee, picked them out-- not Mrs. Lippett, thank goodness. I have an evening dress, pink mull over silk (I'm perfectly beautiful in that), and a blue church dress, and a dinner dress of red veiling with Oriental trimming (makes me look like a Gipsy), and another of rose-coloured challis, and a grey street suit, and an every-day dress for classes. That wouldn't be an awfully big wardrobe for Julia Rutledge Pendleton, perhaps, but for Jerusha Abbott--Oh, my!	您还没听说过我的衣服，是吗？我有6件漂亮的新衣服——是专为我买的，而不是什么人穿了嫌大嫌小的衣服。也许您无法理解这在一个孤儿的生命中意味着什么。这些都是您给我的，我非常非常地感激您。可以受教育固然不错，不过没有什么事比拥有6件新衣服更让人快乐的了。这些衣服都是参访团的普查德小姐替我挑的，感谢上帝幸好不是李皮太太。一件是缀着石竹花的丝绸晚礼服（我穿上很美），一件蓝色礼拜服，两件餐服：一件是红色面料，上面镶着东方花边（我穿上后像个吉卜赛人）；另一件是玫瑰红印花布料的；一套日常穿的灰色套服；还有一件是平时上课穿的。这些服装对茱莉亚•平莱顿来说算不得什么，可是对Jerusha Abbott来说——天呀，委实了不起。
I suppose you're thinking now what a frivolous, shallow little beast she is, and what a waste of money to educate a girl?	我猜您现在一定这样想——她是如此轻浮浅薄，多么愚蠢的女孩子啊！让这样一个女孩子受教育真是浪费钱！
But, Daddy, if you'd been dressed in checked ginghams all your life, you'd appreciate how I feel. And when I started to the high school, I entered upon another period even worse than the checked ginghams.	不过叔叔，要是您—辈子除了花格布，没穿过别的，您会明白我的感受的。我上高中以后，穿的比花格布还不如呢。
You can't know how I dreaded appearing in school in those miserable poor-box dresses. I was perfectly sure to be put down in class next to the girl who first owned my dress, and she would whisper and giggle and point it out to the others. The bitterness of wearing your enemies' cast-off clothes eats into your soul. If I wore silk stockings for the rest of my life, I don't believe I could obliterate the scar.	您无法想像我多么害怕穿那些可怕的救济服出现在学校里，我担心邻座的姑娘原本就是衣服的主人，而她会偷偷将这事告诉别的姑娘，又讲又笑并对我指指点点。想到也许穿着自己讨厌的人扔掉的衣服，真是心如刀绞。即使我今后一辈子都能穿上长统丝袜，也无法抹去心头的伤痕。
PS. I know I'm not to expect any letters in return, and I've been warned not to bother you with questions, but tell me, Daddy, just this once--are you awfully old or just a little old? And are you perfectly bald or just a little bald? It is very difficult thinking about you in the abstract like a theorem in geometry.	又及：我知道我不该奢求得到回信，而我也被告诫过不要拿问题来打扰您。不过，长腿叔叔，就此一次，下不为例——您是老态龙钟呢，还是半老？头发全部脱落了呢，还是刚刚有些秃顶？从没见过您而要来想象，真是有点困难。
Given a tall rich man who hates girls, but is very generous to one quite impertinent girl, what does he look like?	一个身材高高的，厌恶女孩子却又对一个卤莽无礼的女孩子慷慨相助的人，该是长得什么样子呢？
You never answered my question and it was very important.	您对我的问题置之不理，但对我来说那是非常重要的。
I have it planned exactly what you look like--very satisfactorily-- until I reach the top of your head, and then I AM stuck. I can't decide whether you have white hair or black hair or sort of sprinkly grey hair or maybe none at all.	我画着您的长像——一切都很顺利——直到您的头顶，我卡壳了。我无法确定您的头发是白的、黑的或灰的，或者干脆秃顶。
Would you like to know what colour your eyes are? They're grey, and your eyebrows stick out like a porch roof (beetling, they're called in novels), and your mouth is a straight line with a tendency to turn down at the corners. Oh, you see, I know! You're a snappy old thing with a temper. 	您想知道您的眼睛是什么颜色吗？灰色的，眉毛突出像廊檐（小说中称为悬崖）。嘴像两角下垂的一条直线。对啦，您瞧，我晓得！您肯定是—个精神饱满、脾气暴躁的老家伙。
I have a new unbreakable rule: never, never to study at night no matter how many written reviews are coming in the morning. Instead, I read just plain books--I have to, you know, because there are eighteen blank years behind me. You wouldn't believe, Daddy, what an abyss of ignorance my mind is; I am just realizing the depths myself. The things that most girls with a properly assorted family and a home and friends and a library know by absorption, I have never heard of. For example:	我给自己订了一条雷打不动严格的规定：绝不……绝不在晚上学习，只看小说，不管隔天有多少测验——我不得不这样，您知道的，我已经白白地浪费了18年。您无法想像，叔叔，我是多么无知。我才刚开始知道自己的浅薄。一个正常的有家庭、有朋友、有图书馆陪伴的女孩子自然而然知道的事情，对我而言却是闻所未闻的。例如：
I never read Mother Goose or David Copperfield or Ivanhoe or Cinderella or Blue Beard or Robinson Crusoe or Jane Eyre or Alice in Wonderland or a word of Rudyard Kipling. I didn't know that Henry the Eighth was married more than once or that Shelley was a poet. I didn't know that people used to be monkeys and that the Garden of Eden was a beautiful myth. I didn't know that R. L. S. stood for Robert Louis Stevenson or that George Eliot was a lady. I had never seen a picture of the 'Mona Lisa' and (it's true but you won't believe it) I had never heard of Sherlock Holmes.	我从没听过《鹅妈妈》或《蓝胡子》或《劫后英雄传》或《灰姑娘》或《罗宾逊》或《简•爱》或是《爱丽丝漫游记》，或者吉卜林的片言只语，我不知道亨利八世曾经再婚，雪莱是诗人，人的祖先是猴子，也没有听说过伊甸园是个美丽的神话。我不知道R．L．S是罗伯特•路易斯•史蒂文生的缩写，更不知乔治•艾略特是女性。我从未看过一幅叫《蒙娜丽莎的微笑》的画，也从未听说过什么福尔摩斯。
Now, I know all of these things and a lot of others besides, but you can see how much I need to catch up. And oh, but it's fun! I look forward all day to evening, and then I put an 'engaged' on the door and get into my nice red bath robe and furry slippers and pile all the cushions behind me on the couch, and light the brass student lamp at my elbow, and read and read and read one book isn't enough. 	现在，这些东西我都知道了，还知道了一大堆其他的东西，您瞧！我还必须奋发努力跟上进度。喔！不过这是件有趣的事：我盼望黄昏早些降临，好在门口挂上“读书中”的牌子，然后穿上我舒服的红睡袍和皮拖鞋，把枕头堆在椅背上，打开手边的台灯，然后埋头读啊……读啊，一直读下去。
I have four going at once. Just now, they're Tennyson's poems and Vanity Fair and Kipling's Plain Tales and--don't laugh--Little Women. I find that I am the only girl in college who wasn't brought up on Little Women. I haven't told anybody though (that WOULD stamp me as queer). I just quietly went and bought it with $1.12 of my last month's allowance; and the next time somebody mentions pickled limes, I'll know what she is talking about!	一本书嫌不够，我常常找来4本书同时进行。现在，我正在读的是丁尼生的《名利场》和吉卜林的《平凡的故事》。另外，请不要笑话我，还有《小妇人》。我发现自己是大学里惟一没有受到《小妇人》熏陶的姑娘。不过我没告诉任何人，我只是悄悄地溜出去，用上个月剩的1.12块零用钱买了它。如果再有人提起腌酸橙，我就知道他们在讲些什么了。
I have the honour to report fresh explorations in the field of geometry. On Friday last we abandoned our former works in parallelopipeds and proceeded to truncated prisms. We are finding the road rough and very uphill.	我十分高兴地告诉您我在几何学方面取得的成绩。上周五我们放弃了平行六面体的功课，转而学习截头棱柱体。学习的道路艰难坎坷。
The Christmas holidays begin next week and the trunks are up. The corridors are so filled up that you can hardly get through, and everybody is so bubbling over with excitement that studying is getting left out. I'm going to have a beautiful time in vacation; there's another Freshman who lives in Texas staying behind, and we are planning to take long walks and if there's any ice-- learn to skate. Then there is still the whole library to be read-- and three empty weeks to do it in!	下个星期圣诞假期就要到了。过道里全是行李箱，满得难以通行，大家兴高采烈，把学业全都抛到脑外。我也要好好享受自己的假期了，一个德州的新生也准备留下来，我们计划要远行，如果有冰的话，我们还要学溜冰。还有一整座图书馆的书可读——有整整3个星期可以在里面读!
PS. Don't forget to answer my question. If you don't want the trouble of writing, have your secretary telegraph. He can just say: Mr. Smith is quite bald, or Mr. Smith is not bald, or Mr. Smith has white hair.	又及：别忘了答复我的问题。您若无法提笔，也可请秘书代劳。只消说：史密斯先生很秃或史密斯先生不秃或史密斯满头白发。
"Ah！ Ah！ I am about to receive a visit from an admirer！" he exclaimed from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming.	“喔唷！一个崇拜我的人来拜访了！”这个爱虚荣的人一见到小王子，老远就叫喊起来。
For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.	在那些爱虚荣的人眼里，别人都成了他们的崇拜者。
"Good morning," said the little prince. "That is a queer hat you are wearing."	“你好！”小王子说道。“你的帽子很奇怪。”
"It is a hat for salutes," the conceited man replied. "It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way."	“这是为了向人致意用的。”爱虚荣的人回答道，“当人们向我欢呼的时候，我就用帽子向他们致意。可惜，没有一个人经过这里。”
"Clap your hands, one against the other," the conceited man now directed him.	爱虚荣的人向小王子建议道：“你用一只手去拍另一只手。”
The little prince clapped his hands. The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.	小王子就拍起巴掌来。这位爱虚荣者就谦逊地举起帽子向小王子致意。
"This is more entertaining than the visit to the king," the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other. The conceited man against raised his hat in salute.	小王子心想：“这比访问那位国王有趣。”于是他又拍起巴掌来。爱虚荣者又举起帽子来向他致意。
After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game's monotony.	小王子这样做了五分钟，之后对这种单调的把戏有点厌倦了。
But the conceited man did not hear him. Conceited people never hear anything but praise.	可这回爱虚荣者听不进他的话，因为凡是爱虚荣的人只听得进赞美的话。
"To admire mean that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet."	“钦佩么，就是承认我是星球上最美的人，服饰最好的人，最富有的人，最聪明的人。”
"I admire you," said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly, "but what is there in that to interest you so much？"	小王子轻轻地耸了耸肩膀，说道：“我钦佩你，可是，这有什么能使你这样感兴趣的？”
"The grown-ups are certainly very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.	小王子在路上自言自语地说了一句：“这些大人，肯定是十分古怪的。”
Here I am! I travelled yesterday for four hours in a train. It's a funny sensation, isn't it? I never rode in one before.	我终于到了！昨天搭了4个钟头的火车。心中充满了新奇感，不是吗？我还从来没有坐过火车呢。
College is the biggest, most bewildering place--I get lost whenever I leave my room. I will write you a description later when I'm feeling less muddled; also I will tell you about my lessons. Classes don't begin until Monday morning, and this is Saturday night. But I wanted to write a letter first just to get acquainted.	校园真是好大，是很容易把人搞糊涂的地方——我只要一离开房间就会迷路。等我对周围环境熟悉了一些再对您描绘我的校园，并汇报我的功课。现在是星期六晚上，要到下星期一早上才开课。不过我还是想先写封信让我们彼此认识一下。
It seems queer to be writing letters to somebody you don't know. It seems queer for me to be writing letters at all--I've never written more than three or four in my life, so please overlook it if these are not a model kind.	写信给陌生人是件挺奇怪的事。对我来说，写信本来就够奇怪的……我这辈子到现在就写过3封信，要是写得不规范，请您多多原谅。
Before leaving yesterday morning, Mrs. Lippett and I had a very serious talk. She told me how to behave all the rest of my life, and especially how to behave towards the kind gentleman who is doing so much for me. I must take care to be Very Respectful.	不过昨天早上出发前，李皮太太和我作了一次严肃的谈话。她告诫我今后一辈子如何为人处世，尤其对有恩于我的好心先生更要注意自己的言行。我一定记得对您要非常的“尊敬”。
But how can one be very respectful to a person who wishes to be called John Smith? Why couldn't you have picked out a name with a little personality? I might as well write letters to Dear Hitching-Post or Dear Clothes-Prop.	不过，对一个叫约翰•史密斯的人，怎么尊敬得起来呢？您为什么不挑个有点个性的名字呢？我好比在给亲爱的拴马桩或衣服架写信。
I have been thinking about you a great deal this summer; having somebody take an interest in me after all these years makes me feel as though I had found a sort of family. It seems as though I belonged to somebody now, and it's a very comfortable sensation. I must say, however, that when I think about you, my imagination has very little to work upon. There are just three things that I know:	整个夏天我想了很多关于您的事。这么多年来突然有人关心我，让我觉得好像找到家一样，觉得有了归属感，这是一种令人陶醉的感觉。但不论如何，我必须承认，当我想到您的时候，我的脑子总是空荡荡的。我只知道三件事：
I suppose I might call you Dear Mr. Girl-Hater. Only that's rather insulting to me. Or Dear Mr. Rich-Man, but that's insulting to you, as though money were the only important thing about you. Besides, being rich is such a very external quality. Maybe you won't stay rich all your life; lots of very clever men get smashed up in Wall Street. But at least you will stay tall all your life! So I've decided to call you Dear Daddy-Long-Legs. I hope you won't mind. It's just a private pet name we won't tell Mrs. Lippett.	我想我可以称您为“亲爱的恨女人先生”，不过这有伤我的自尊。或许我可以称您为“亲爱的有钱人”，不过这样又侮辱您的人格，好像您惟一值得提的就是钱。此外，“富有”是一种很肤浅的特征。您也许不会一辈子都有钱，有很多聪明人也都在华尔街惨遭滑铁卢。不过您的身高是改变不了的，所以我决定称您为亲爱的长腿叔叔。希望您别介意。这只是个私底下的称呼，不必要告诉Lippett太太。
The ten o'clock bell is going to ring in two minutes. Our day is divided into sections by bells. We eat and sleep and study by bells. It's very enlivening; I feel like a fire horse all of the time. There it goes！Lights out. Good night.	再有两分钟，10点的钟声就要响了。我们的一天被钟声分成好几段。我们吃饭、睡觉和上课都照着钟声来。这让我生气十足，我随时都像匹野马。该熄灯了。晚安。
Observe with what precision I obey rules--due to my training in the John Grier Home. 	瞧！我多守规矩——全亏约翰•格利尔孤儿院的训练。
I love college and I love you for sending me--I'm very, very happy, and so excited every moment of the time that I can scarcely sleep. You can't imagine how different it is from the John Grier Home. I never dreamed there was such a place in the world. I'm feeling sorry for everybody who isn't a girl and who can't come here; I am sure the college you attended when you were a boy couldn't have been so nice.	我喜欢大学，也喜欢送我来这的您——我真的非常非常快乐，时时刻刻都兴奋得快睡不着了。您无法想像这里跟约翰•格利尔孤儿院是多么得不同。我从不知道世上还有这样的好地方。我深深地为那些不是女孩，不能来上大学的人感到难过。我相信您以前读的大学一定没有这么好。
My room is up in a tower that used to be the contagious ward before they built the new infirmary. There are three other girls on the same floor of the tower--a Senior who wears spectacles and is always asking us please to be a little more quiet, and two Freshmen named Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton. Sallie has red hair and a turn-up nose and is quite friendly; Julia comes from one of the first families in New York and hasn't noticed me yet. They room together and the Senior and I have singles. Usually Freshmen can't get singles; they are very scarce, but I got one without even asking. I suppose the registrar didn't think it would be right to ask a properly brought-up girl to room with a foundling. You see there are advantages!	我的房间在新医务室盖好前，被用来当做传染病房的大楼里。这层楼还有另外3个女孩子——一个戴眼镜的高年级女生，老是要人家安静一点，还有两个新生，莎莉•麦克白与茱莉亚•平莱顿。莎莉有一头红发和一个翘鼻子，人很和气。茱莉亚出身纽约名门，还没注意到我。她们俩同屋，那高年级女生跟我住单人房。单间很少，新生一般不能住，我甚至没提要求就得到了一间。我猜是注册处的人觉得让有教养的女孩跟孤儿住在一起不太妥当。您瞧，还有优越性呢!
My room is on the north-west corner with two windows and a view. After you've lived in a ward for eighteen years with twenty room-mates, it is restful to be alone. This is the first chance I've ever had to get acquainted with Jerusha Abbott. I think I'm going to like her.	我的房间在西北角，有两扇窗，窗外景色宜人。在跟20个人在一个宿舍住了18年，如今独处一室，感到很轻松。我想这是让我认识乔若莎•艾伯特的良机。我想我会喜欢她的。
They are organizing the Freshman basket-ball team and there's just a chance that I shall get in it. I'm little of course, but terribly quick and wiry and tough. While the others are hopping about in the air, I can dodge under their feet and grab the ball. It's loads of fun practising--out in the athletic field in the afternoon with the trees all red and yellow and the air full of the smell of burning leaves, and everybody laughing and shouting. These are the happiest girls I ever saw--and I am the happiest of all!	她们正在招募新生篮球队，我要去争取这个机会。没错，我是长得很瘦小，不过我反应很敏捷，身体强壮，当其他人跳到半空中时，我可以从她们的脚底下抢到球。练球很有意思。下午，操场前满树红叶、黄叶，空气中充满了燃烧落叶的气味，大家又叫又笑的。这是我所见到的最快乐的女孩们了，而我是其中最快乐的一个。
I meant to write a long letter and tell you all the things I'm learning (Mrs. Lippett said you wanted to know), but 7th hour has just rung, and in ten minutes I'm due at the athletic field in gymnasium clothes. Don't you hope I'll get in the team?	本来打算写封长信跟您谈谈我的功课(李皮太太说过您想知道的)。不过第7堂课刚结束，再过10分种我就要换好运动服在空地上集合了。您希望我会入选吧？
Sallie McBride just poked her head in at my door. This is what she said: 'I'm so homesick that I simply can't stand it. Do you feel that way?'	莎莉•麦克白刚才探头进来说：“我想家想得快受不了了，你呢？”
I smiled a little and said no; I thought I could pull through. At least homesickness is one disease that I've escaped! I never heard of anybody being asylum-sick, did you?	我笑了笑说：“才不呢。”我想我能挺得过去。至少思乡病是我绝不会染上的疾病，没听说过有人想孤儿院的，是吗？
He was a famous artist who lived in Italy in the Middle Ages. Everybody in English Literature seemed to know about him, and the whole class laughed because I thought he was an archangel. He sounds like an archangel, doesn't he? The trouble with college is that you are expected to know such a lot of things you've never learned. It's very embarrassing at times. But now, when the girls talk about things that I never heard of, I just keep still and look them up in the encyclopedia.	他是中世纪意大利著名画家，上英国文学课的人好像都知道他。我说他是个天使，惹得全班哄堂大笑。可那名字听上去很像天使，您说是吗？糟糕的是在大学里，大家都认为你应该懂得一些你根本没学过的东西。有时真的让人很尴尬，不过现在只要女孩们提到我不懂的事，我就闭口不言，而是回去查查字典。
I made an awful mistake the first day. Somebody mentioned Maurice Maeterlinck, and I asked if she was a Freshman. That joke has gone all over college. But anyway, I'm just as bright in class as any of the others--and brighter than some of them!	上学第一天我闹了一个大笑话，有人提到麦特林克，而我就问她是不是个大一新生。这个笑话传遍了整所大学。还好，我在课堂上表现得比谁都不笨，甚至比一些人还要好。
Do you care to know how I've furnished my room? It's a symphony in brown and yellow. The wall was tinted buff, and I've bought yellow denim curtains and cushions and a mahogany desk (second hand for three dollars) and a rattan chair and a brown rug with an ink spot in the middle. I stand the chair over the spot.	您想知道我的房间布置吗？它是一曲棕黄相间的交响乐。淡黄色的墙壁，配上我买来的黄色粗布窗帘和靠垫，一张3美元的旧红木书桌，一把藤椅，一条正中有墨水迹的棕色地毯，我把椅子放在有墨迹的地方。
The windows are up high; you can't look out from an ordinary seat. But I unscrewed the looking-glass from the back of the bureau, upholstered the top and moved it up against the window. It's just the right height for a window seat. You pull out the drawers like steps and walk up. Very comfortable!	窗户很高，坐在椅子上望不到窗外。我把镜台上的镜子拆掉，铺上桌布，随后移到窗前，坐在上面看窗外高矮正合适。我把抽屉开成阶梯式，上来下去，真够舒服的。
Sallie McBride helped me choose the things at the Senior auction. She has lived in a house all her life and knows about furnishing. You can't imagine what fun it is to shop and pay with a real five-dollar bill and get some change--when you've never had more than a few cents in your life. I assure you, Daddy dear, I do appreciate that allowance.	这些东西是莎莉•麦可白帮我在高年级学生办的拍卖会上挑的。她从小到大都在家里住，对于家具摆饰颇有经验。如果您这辈子从没拿超过5毛钱，您是很难体会那种购物的乐趣。用一张真的5元钞票去买东西，还能找些零头回来！我向您保证，亲爱的叔叔，我对您给的零用钱真的心存感激。
Sallie is the most entertaining person in the world--and Julia Rutledge Pendleton the least so. It's queer what a mixture the registrar can make in the matter of room-mates. Sallie thinks everything is funny--even flunking--and Julia is bored at everything. She never makes the slightest effort to be amiable. She believes that if you are a Pendleton, that fact alone admits you to heaven without any further examination. Julia and I were born to be enemies.	莎莉算是全世界最好的人了，而茱莉亚•平莱顿则相反。注册处的人将这么一对安排在一起，可真够古怪的。莎莉觉得每件事，甚至连考试不及格都很有趣。而茱莉亚则不然，事事都让她不开心，对人从未有过亲切的表示。也许她相信，只要是平莱顿家族的，无庸置疑一定可以上天堂的——茱莉亚跟我是天生的冤家。
I. Latin: Second Punic war. Hannibal and his forces pitched camp at Lake Trasimenus last night. They prepared an ambuscade for the Romans, and a battle took place at the fourth watch this morning. Romans in retreat.	一、拉丁文：第二次布匿战争。昨晚，汉尼拔和他的部队在特拉西美诺湖安营扎寨。他们在罗马人周围埋下伏兵，凌晨四点打了一仗，罗马人在退却。
II. French: 24 pages of the Three Musketeers and third conjugation, irregular verbs.	二、法文：读了24页《三剑客》，学了第三组不规则动词的变位。
IV. English: Studying exposition. My style improves daily in clearness and brevity.	四、英文：学习表达能力。我的风格日益清晰、简练。
V. Physiology: Reached the digestive system. Bile and the pancreas next time. 	五、生理学：进行到消化系统，下节课学胆和胰。
PS. I hope you never touch alcohol, Daddy? It does dreadful things to your liver.	又及：我希望您滴酒不沾，长腿叔叔。酒能伤肝。
I'm still 'Jerusha' in the catalogue, but I'm 'Judy' everywhere else. It's really too bad, isn't it, to have to give yourself the only pet name you ever had? I didn't quite make up the Judy though. That's what Freddy Perkins used to call me before he could talk plainly.	在学校花名册上我仍叫乔若莎，不过在其他场合我就叫茱蒂了。要自己为自己取一个小名实在很悲哀，不是吗？不过茱蒂也不是我凭空捏造的。弗莱迪•珀金斯牙牙学语前，都是这样叫我的。
I wish Mrs. Lippett would use a little more ingenuity about choosing babies' names. She gets the last names out of the telephone book-- you'll find Abbott on the first page--and she picks the Christian names up anywhere; she got Jerusha from a tombstone. I've always hated it; but I rather like Judy. It's such a silly name. It belongs to the kind of girl I'm not--a sweet little blue-eyed thing, petted and spoiled by all the family, who romps her way through life without any cares. Wouldn't it be nice to be like that? Whatever faults I may have, no one can ever accuse me of having been spoiled by my family! But it's great fun to pretend I've been. In the future please always address me as Judy.	我希望李皮太太以后在给小宝宝取名字时能多动一点点脑筋。她从电话簿上取我们的姓氏——您要是翻开第一页就会看到艾伯特了。而名字则都是信手拈来的，乔若莎是她从一块墓碑上看到的。我一直都很讨厌这名字，不过我挺喜欢茱蒂的。这是一个傻呼呼的名字，应该是一个与我完全不同的女孩子，一个有一双蓝眼睛，甜甜的，娇生惯养，什么都不用烦恼地过一辈子的女孩子。那样该有多好啊！不管我犯了什么错，都没人可以说是我的家人把我惯坏的。不过假装一下也挺好玩的。以后就请叫我茱蒂。
Do you want to know something? I have three pairs of kid gloves. I've had kid mittens before from the Christmas tree, but never real kid gloves with five fingers. I take them out and try them on every little while. It's all I can do not to wear them to classes.	您想知道吗？我有3副羊皮手套了。从前，在挂在圣诞树上的礼物中我得到过羊皮无指手套，但从来没有分开手指的那种真的羊皮手套。我不时拿出来戴在手上，好容易才忍住没有戴到教室去。
The first Wednesday in every month was a Perfectly Awful Day--a day to be awaited with dread, endured with courage and forgotten with haste. Every floor must be spotless, every chair dustless, and every bed without a wrinkle. Ninety-seven squirming little orphans must be scrubbed and combed and buttoned into freshly starched ginghams; and all ninety-seven reminded of their manners, and told to say, 'Yes, sir,' 'No, sir,' whenever a Trustee spoke.	每个月的第一个星期三是个糟糕的日子——它是个在忧虑中等待，勇敢地忍耐，然后在忙碌中忘记的日子。这一天，每层楼的地板都必须纤尘不染，每张椅子都要光洁照人，全部床单都不能有半条皱褶。还要把97个四处乱跳的小孤儿梳洗一遍，给他们穿上浆洗过的格子衬衫，嘱咐他们要注意礼貌。回答理事们的问话时要说，“是的，先生。”“不是的，先生。”
It was a distressing time; and poor Jerusha Abbott, being the oldest orphan, had to bear the brunt of it. But this particular first Wednesday, like its predecessors, finally dragged itself to a close. Jerusha escaped from the pantry where she had been making sandwiches for the asylum's guests, and turned upstairs to accomplish her regular work. Her special care was room F, where eleven little tots, from four to seven, occupied eleven little cots set in a row. Jerusha assembled her charges, straightened their rumpled frocks, wiped their noses, and started them in an orderly and willing line towards the dining-room to engage themselves for a blessed half hour with bread and milk and prune pudding.	这个日子真是令人沮丧，可怜的乔若莎·艾伯特，作为孤儿院里年纪最大的孤儿当然更加倒霉。不过，这个特别的星期三，终于到头了。乔若莎离开了厨房，她刚在这里为来客们做了三明治，现在正跑回楼上完成她每天的例行工作。她负责第6室，那里有11个4岁到7岁的小家伙和11张排成一列的小床。乔若莎好不容易把他们叫过来，帮他们整理好皱巴巴的衣服，擦干净鼻涕，排成一行，然后带领他们去餐室，在那里他们可以尽情地享受半小时的好时光，喝牛奶，吃面包和梅子布丁。
Then she dropped down on the window seat and leaned throbbing temples against the cool glass. She had been on her feet since five that morning, doing everybody's bidding, scolded and hurried by a nervous matron. Mrs. Lippett, behind the scenes, did not always maintain that calm and pompous dignity with which she faced an audience of Trustees and lady visitors. Jerusha gazed out across a broad stretch of frozen lawn, beyond the tall iron paling that marked the confines of the asylum, down undulating ridges sprinkled with country estates, to the spires of the village rising from the midst of bare trees.	她疲惫地跌坐在窗台的椅子上，把涨得发疼的太阳穴贴着冰冷的玻璃。从早晨5点钟开始，她的手脚就不停地忙碌着，听从所有人的命令，还不时被神经兮兮的女监事骂得晕头转向。私下的李皮太太可不是像她面对理事们和来访的女士面前表现的那样冷静、庄重。乔若莎的眼神掠过孤儿院高高的铁栏杆外一片上了冻的开阔草地，看到远处起伏的山峰，山上散落的村舍，光秃秃的树丛中露出了房屋的尖顶。
The day was ended--quite successfully, so far as she knew. The Trustees and the visiting committee had made their rounds, and read their reports, and drunk their tea, and now were hurrying home to their own cheerful firesides, to forget their bothersome little charges for another month. Jerusha leaned forward watching with curiosity--and a touch of wistfulness--the stream of carriages and automobiles that rolled out of the asylum gates. In imagination she followed first one equipage, then another, to the big houses dotted along the hillside. She pictured herself in a fur coat and a velvet hat trimmed with feathers leaning back in the seat and nonchalantly murmuring 'Home' to the driver. But on the door-sill of her home the picture grew blurred.	这一天就算过去了——就她所知应该是圆满落幕，因为没有出现任何差错。理事们和来访团已经巡视过一遍，听取了汇报，也喝了茶，现在正忙着赶回自家温暖的炉火边，起码要再过一个月才会想起这些需要他们照管的磨人的小家伙。乔若莎倚着窗台，好奇地看着一连串的马车、汽车穿过孤儿院的大门。她不禁产生了幻想。她想象自己跟着一辆又一辆车，来到坐落在山脚下的密密麻麻的大房子前。她看见自己穿着一件貂皮大衣，带着天鹅绒装饰的丝织帽子靠在车座上，漫不经心地对司机说“回家！”不过，当她回到家门口，整个想象就变得模糊不清了。
Jerusha had an imagination--an imagination, Mrs. Lippett told her, that would get her into trouble if she didn't take care--but keen as it was, it could not carry her beyond the front porch of the houses she would enter. Poor, eager, adventurous little Jerusha, in all her seventeen years, had never stepped inside an ordinary house; she could not picture the daily routine of those other human beings who carried on their lives undiscommoded by orphans.	乔若莎喜欢幻想——李皮太太说，如果不小心，幻想就会让她惹上麻烦。但是，不管她的想象力多么丰富，都无法带领她走进那些渴望进入的大门，她只能待在门廊上。可怜的充满冒险精神的小乔若莎，在她17年的岁月里，从未进入任何一个家庭。她完全无法想象，其他没有孤儿干扰的人们会有怎样的日常生活。
Tommy Dillon, who had joined the choir, came singing up the stairs and down the corridor, his chant growing louder as he approached room F. Jerusha wrenched herself from the window and refaced the troubles of life.	汤米·狄伦刚加入了唱诗班，他唱着歌经过楼梯和走廊，当他走向第6室时，声音越来越响。乔若莎将思绪从窗外收回来，再次面对生活中的麻烦。
'Who wants me?' she cut into Tommy's chant with a note of sharp anxiety.	“谁在叫我？”她打断汤米的哼唱，急切地问道。
Tommy piously intoned, but his accent was not entirely malicious. Even the most hardened little orphan felt sympathy for an erring sister who was summoned to the office to face an annoyed matron; and Tommy liked Jerusha even if she did sometimes jerk him by the arm and nearly scrub his nose off.	汤米依然拉长腔调，他的语气并没有幸灾乐祸的意思。即便是心肠最硬的小孤儿也会同情这个做了错事的姐姐，因为她将要去见那个讨厌的院长。更何况，汤米还挺喜欢乔若莎，虽然她偶尔会使劲地扯他的胳膊，给他洗脸时几乎擦掉他的鼻子！
The long lower hall had not been lighted, and as she came downstairs, a last Trustee stood, on the point of departure, in the open door that led to the porte-cochere. Jerusha caught only a fleeting impression of the man--and the impression consisted entirely of tallness. He was waving his arm towards an automobile waiting in the curved drive. As it sprang into motion and approached, head on for an instant, the glaring headlights threw his shadow sharply against the wall inside. The shadow pictured grotesquely elongated legs and arms that ran along the floor and up the wall of the corridor.	低矮的长廊上已经灭了灯，当她下楼时，最后一个理事站在那儿正打算离开。他站在通往院外的大门前，乔若莎看了一眼这个人，只有一个感觉——高。他正朝院外一辆等待的汽车招手，汽车发动时，耀眼的灯光把他的影子投射在屋子的墙上，怪模怪样的影子把手脚都拉长了，滑稽的样子从地板一直延伸到走廊的墙壁上。
Jerusha's anxious frown gave place to quick laughter. She was by nature a sunny soul, and had always snatched the tiniest excuse to be amused. If one could derive any sort of entertainment out of the oppressive fact of a Trustee, it was something unexpected to the good. She advanced to the office quite cheered by the tiny episode, and presented a smiling face to Mrs. Lippett. To her surprise the matron was also, if not exactly smiling, at least appreciably affable; she wore an expression almost as pleasant as the one she donned for visitors.	乔若莎顿时展开紧锁的眉头，欢快地笑起来。她是个天性乐观的姑娘，一点小事都能让她开怀大笑。能够从一个使人压抑的理事身上发现笑料，确实让人感到意外。这段小插曲让她很高兴，以至她进入办公室见到李皮太太时，脸上还带着笑容。出乎意料的是，院长也在对她笑，就算不是真的笑容，但表情还算和蔼。她几乎像对来访的客人一样充满善意。
Jerusha dropped into the nearest chair and waited with a touch of breathlessness. An automobile flashed past the window; Mrs. Lippett glanced after it. 'Did you notice the gentleman who has just gone?'	乔若莎坐在最近的椅子上，屏息等待。一辆汽车从窗前驶过，光芒掠过窗户。李皮太太注视着远去的车子问：“你是否注意到了刚走的那位先生？”
'He is one of our most affluential Trustees, and has given large sums of money towards the asylum's support. I am not at liberty to mention his name; he expressly stipulated that he was to remain unknown.'	“他是理事中最富有的人之一，曾给孤儿院捐了大笔的钱。我不能告诉你他的姓名，因为他特意要求不要透露他的姓名。”
Jerusha's eyes widened slightly; she was not accustomed to being summoned to the office to discuss the eccentricities of Trustees with the matron.	乔若莎微微张大了双眼。她不太习惯被院长叫到办公室一起讨论理事们的怪癖。
'This gentleman has taken an interest in several of our boys. You remember Charles Benton and Henry Freize? They were both sent through college by Mr.--er--this Trustee, and both have repaid with hard work and success the money that was so generously expended. Other payment the gentleman does not wish. Heretofore his philanthropies have been directed solely towards the boys; I have never been able to interest him in the slightest degree in any of the girls in the institution, no matter how deserving. He does not, I may tell you, care for girls.'	“这位先生非常关照孤儿院的几个男孩子。你记得查理·班顿和亨利·弗理兹吧？他们都是被这位先生……哦，这位理事送去上大学的。两人都很用功，用良好的成绩回报了他慷慨的资助。这位先生并不要求别的回报。到目前为止，他的仁慈仅限于男孩子，我从来都无法做到让他对女孩们留心，哪怕她们多么出色。我可以告诉你，他对女孩子没有什么兴趣。”
'ma'am,' Jerusha murmured, since some reply seemed to be expected at this point.	“太太。”乔若莎喃喃地开口，因为此刻这个问题似乎需要她的回答。
'To-day at the regular meeting, the question of your future was brought up.'	“在今天的例会上，有人提到你的去向问题。”
Mrs. Lippett allowed a moment of silence to fall, then resumed in a slow, placid manner extremely trying to her hearer's suddenly tightened nerves.	李皮太太略微停顿了一下，然后才慢条斯理地往下说。这让她的听众突然绷紧了神经，非常痛苦。
"Well, you boys had better start thinking. You're staring at one of life's biggest lessons. If you learn the lesson, you'll enjoy a life of great freedom and security. If you don't learn the lesson, you'll wind up like Mrs. Martin and most of the people playing softball in this park. They work very hard, for little money, clinging to the illusion of job security, looking forward to a three-week vacation each year and a skimpy pension after forty-five years of work. If that excites you, I'll give you a raise to 25 cents an hour."	“你们正在学习一生中最重要的一课，你们应该学会思考。”富爸爸说道，“如果你学会了这一课，你将一生享受自由和安宁；如果没有学好这一课，你们就会像马丁太太和其他在这空场里玩垒球的人一样了此一生。他们为一点点钱而勤奋工作，兼有一种有工作的虚幻安全感，盼着一年三周的假期和工作45年后获得的一小笔养老金。如果你喜欢这样，我就把工资提到每小时25美分。”
"But these are good hard-working people. Are you making fun of them?" I demanded.	“但他们都是努力工作的好人啊，你在嘲笑他们吗？”我问道。
"Mrs. Martin is like a mother to me. I would never be that cruel. I may sound cruel because I'm doing my best to point something out to the two of you. I want to expand your point of view so you can see something. Something most people never have the benefit of seeing because their vision is too narrow. Most people never see the trap they are in."	“马丁太太对我就像妈妈一样，我决不会那么残忍地对她。我上面的话可能听起来很无情，可是我正尽力向你俩说明一些事情。我想拓宽你们的视野以便让你们看清一些东西。这些东西甚至大多数成年人也从未有看见过，因为他们眼界狭窄，大多数人从未认识到他们身处困境。”
Mike and I sat there uncertain of his message. He sounded cruel, yet we could sense he was desperately wanting us to know something.	迈克和我还是不太明白他的话。他听起来很无情，然而我们能感到他确实急于想让我们明白一些事情。
With a smile, rich dad said, "Doesn't that 25 cents an hour sound good? Doesn't it make your heart beat a little faster."	富爸爸笑着又说了：“25美分1小时怎么样？这样是否能让你们心跳加速？”
I shook my head "no," but it really did. Twenty five cents an hour would be big bucks to me.	我摇摇头说：“不会啊”，可事实上，25美分1小时对我而言可真是一大笔钱啊！
"OK, I'll pay you a dollar an hour," rich dad said, with a sly grin.	“好，我每小时给你1美元。”富爸爸带着狡黠的笑容说。
Now my heart was beginning to race. My brain was screaming, "Take it. Take it." I could not believe what I was hearing. Still, I said nothing.	我的心开始狂跳，头也开始发晕。“接受，快接受。”我的心里在喊，但我不相信我所听到的，所以什么也没说。
My little 9-year-old brain and heart nearly exploded. After all, it was 1956 and being paid $2 an hour would have made me the richest kid in the world. I couldn't imagine earning that kind of money. I wanted to say "yes." I wanted the deal. I could see a new bicycle, new baseball glove, and adoration of my friends when I flashed some cash. On top of that, Jimmy and his rich friends could never call me poor again. But somehow my mouth stayed silent.	我那9岁的大脑和心脏几乎要爆炸了。毕竟这是1956年，每小时2美元将使我成为世界上最有钱的孩子！我无法想像能挣到这么多钱。我想说“好的”，我真想达成这笔交易。我似乎看见一辆新自行车，一副新棒球手套，以及当我拿出钱时同学们羡慕的表情。最重要的是，基米和他的朋友再也不能叫我穷人了，但不知怎么我仍未开口。
Maybe my brain had overheated and blown a fuse. But deep down, I badly wanted that $2 an hour.	也许我的脑袋已经热昏了，但内心深处，我极其想要那每小时的2美元。
The ice cream had melted and was running down my hand. The ice-cream stick was empty, and under it was a sticky mess of vanilla and chocolate that ants were enjoying.	冰淇淋化了，流到了我手上。冰淇淋筒已经空了，蚂蚁正在享受着一团香精和巧克力。
Rich dad was looking at two boys staring back at him, eyes wide open and brains empty. He knew he was testing us, and he knew there was a part of our emotions that wanted to take the deal. He knew that each human being has a weak and needy part of their soul that can be bought. And he knew that each human being also had a part of their soul that was strong and filled with a resolve that could never be bought. It was only a question of which one was stronger. He had tested thousands of souls in his life. He tested souls every time he interviewed someone for a job.	富爸爸看着两个孩子盯着他，眼睛睁很大大的，脑子里却空空如也。事实上，他正在考验我们，而且他也知道我们很想接受这笔交易。他知道每个人都有可以被击中的弱点，也知道每个人都有一种强大、坚定、无法用金钱收买的精神。问题在于哪一部分更强大。他在一生中考验了成百上千的人，每次的招工面试都是一番考验。
Suddenly there was a silence from inside me. Something had changed. The offer was too big and had gotten ridiculous. Not too many grownups in 1956 made more than $5 an hour. The temptation disappeared, and a calm set in. Slowly I turned to my left to look at Mike. He looked back at me. The part of my soul that was weak and needy was silenced. The part of me that had no price took over. There was a calm and a certainty about money that entered my brain and my soul. I knew Mike had gotten to that point also.	我的内心突然平静下来了，内心发生了一些变化。这个出价太高了，显得有些荒谬。在1956年，连成年人也没有几个人可以每小时挣5美元的。诱惑消失了，平静回来了。我慢慢地转过头去看迈克，他也在看我。我灵魂中软弱而贫乏的一面沉默了，而无法用钱收买的一面占了上风。面对钱，我开始心安神定。我知道迈克也一样。
"Good," rich dad said softly. "Most people have a price. And they have a price because of human emotions named fear and greed. First, the fear of being without money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful things money can buy. The pattern is then set."	“很好，”富爸爸轻轻地说，“大多数人都希望有一份工资收入，之所以会这样是因为他们有恐惧和贪婪之心。先说恐惧感，没钱的恐惧会刺激我们努力工作，当我们得到报酬时，贪婪或欲望又开始让我们去想所有钱能买到的东西。于是就形成了一种模式。”
"The pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills, get up, go to work, pay bills... Their lives are then run forever by two emotions, fear and greed. Offer them more money, and they continue the cycle by also increasing their spending. This is what I call the Rat Race."	“起床，上班，付账，再起床，再上班，再付账……他们的生活就是在无穷尽地为这两种感觉而奔忙：恐惧和贪婪。给他们更多的钱，他们就会以更高的开支重复这种循环。这就是我所说的‘老鼠赛跑’”。
"That's what I hope you boys will find out as you work and study with me. That is why I took away all forms of pay."	“我希望你俩能在工作和跟我学习的过程中找到解决的办法。这就是我不给你们任何工资的原因。”
"Any hints?" Mike asked. "We're kind of tired of working hard, especially for nothing."	“有什么提示吗？”迈克问。“我们工作得很累，尤其是白干的时候。”
"How you're feeling," rich dad said. "You don't have to say it to anyone else. Just yourself."	“靠你感觉，除了你自己谁也不能真正明白你的感觉。”
"You mean the people in this park, the people who work for you, Mrs. Martin, they don't do that?" I asked.	“你说这公园里的人，那些为你工作的人，还有马丁夫人，他们都没弄清楚这些东西？”
"I doubt it," said rich dad. "Instead, they feel the fear of not having money. Instead of confronting the fear, they react instead of think. They react emotionally instead of using their heads," rich dad said, tapping us on our heads. "'Then, they get a few bucks in their hands, and again the emotion of joy and desire and greed take over, and again they react, instead of think."	“我想是的。他们害怕没有钱，不愿面对没钱的恐惧，对此他们作出了反应但不是用他们的头脑。”富爸爸说着拍拍我们的头。“他们会去挣了点小钱，可快乐、欲望、贪婪会接着控制他们，他们会再作出反应，仍然是不加思考。”
"That's correct," said rich dad. "Instead of telling the truth about how they feel, they react to their feeling, fail to think. They feel the fear, they go to work, hoping that money will soothe the fear, but it doesn't. That old fear haunts them, and they go back to work, hoping again that money will calm their fears, and again it doesn't. Fear has them in this trap of working, earning money, working, earning money, hoping the fear will go away. But every day they get up, and that old fear wakes up with them. For millions of people, that old fear keeps them awake all night, causing a night of turmoil and worry. So they get up and go to work, hoping that a paycheck will kill that fear gnawing at their soul. Money is running their lives, and they refuse to tell the truth about that.Money is in control of their emotions and hence their souls."	“正是如此，他们不去分辨真相，不去思考，只是对感受作出反应。他们感到恐惧，于是去工作，希望钱能消除恐惧，但钱不可能消除恐惧。于是，恐惧追逐着他们，他们只好又去工作，希望钱能消除恐惧，但还是无法摆脱恐惧。恐惧使他们落入工作的陷阶，挣钱——工作——挣钱，希望有一天能消除恐惧。但每天他们起床时，就会发现恐惧又同他们一起醒来了。恐惧使成千上万的人彻夜难眠，忧心忡忡。所以他们又起床去工作了，希望薪水能杀死那该死的恐惧。钱主宰着他们的生活，他们拒绝去分辨真相，钱控制了他们的情感和灵魂。”
Rich dad sat quietly, letting his words sink in. Mike and I heard what he said, but really did not understand fully what he was talking about. I just knew that I often wondered why grownups hurried off to work. It did not seem like much fun, and they never looked that happy, but something kept them hurrying off to work.	富爸爸静静地坐着，让他的话音渐渐消失。迈克和我听着他的话，但不能完全明白他在讲些什么。我经常奇怪于大人们为什么总是急急忙忙去工作，这事看起来真是无趣，而且他们看上去也不快活，但好像总有些东西使他们不断地急着去工作。
He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330. He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge.	在附近的宇宙中，还有 325、326、327、328、329、330 等几颗小行星。他就开始访问这几颗星球，想在那里找点事干，并且学习学习。
The first of them was inhabited by a king. Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic.	第一颗星球上住着一个国王。国王穿着用紫红色和白底黑花的毛皮做成的大礼服，坐在一个很简单却又十分威严的宝座上。
"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?"	“他从来也没有见过我，怎么会认识我呢？”
He did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To them, all men are subjects.	他哪里知道，在那些国王的眼里，世界是非常简单的：所有的人都是臣民。
"Approach, so that I may see you better," said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody.	国王十分骄傲，因为他终于成了某个人的国王，他对小王子说道：“靠近些， 好让我好好看看你。”
The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned.	小王子看看四周，想找个地方坐下来，可是整个星球被国王华丽的白底黑花皮袍占满了。他只好站在那里，但是因为疲倦了，他打起哈欠来。
"It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king," the monarch said to him. "I forbid you to do so."	君王对他说：“在一个国王面前打哈欠是违反礼节的。我禁止你打哈欠。”
"I can't help it. I can't stop myself," replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed. "I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep."	小王子羞愧地说道：“我实在忍不住，我长途跋涉来到这里，还没有睡觉呢。”
"Ah, then," the king said. "I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order."	国王说：“那好吧，我命令你打哈欠。好些年来我没有看见过任何人打哈欠。对我来说，打哈欠倒是新奇的事。来吧，再打个哈欠！这是命令。”
"That frightens me… I cannot, any more…" murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.	“这倒叫我有点紧张……我打不出哈欠来了……”小王子红着脸说。
"Hum! Hum!" replied the king. "Then I-- I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to--"	“嗯！嗯！”国王回答道：“那么我——命令你忽而打哈欠，忽而——”
For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected. He tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute monarch. But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.	因为国王所要求的主要是保持他的威严受到尊敬。他不能容忍不听他的命令。 他是一位绝对的君主。可是，他却很善良，他下的命令都是有理智的。
"If I ordered a general," he would say, by way of example, "if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault."	他常常说：“如果我叫一位将军变成一只海鸟，而这位将军不服从我的命令， 那么这就不是将军的过错，而是我的过错。”
"I order you to do so," the king answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle.	“我命令你坐下。”国王一边回答，一边庄重地把他那白底黑花皮袍大襟挪动了一下。
But the little prince was wondering… The planet was tiny. Over what could this king really rule?	可是小王子感到很奇怪。这么小的行星，国王他对什么进行统治呢？
"Sir," he said to him, "I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question--"	他对国王说：“陛下，请原谅，我想问您一个问题——”
The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars.	国王轻轻地用手指着他的行星和其他的行星，以及所有的星星。
For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal.	原来他不仅是一个绝对的君主，而且是整个宇宙的君主。
"Certainly they do," the king said. "They obey instantly. I do not permit insubordination."	“那当然！”国王对他说，“它们立即就得服从。我是不允许无纪律的。”
Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, with out ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor:	这样的权力使小王子惊叹不已。如果掌握了这样的权力，那么，他一天就不只是看到四十三次日落，而可以看到七十二次，甚至一百次，或是二百次日落，也不必要去挪动椅子了！由于他想起了他那被遗弃的小星球，心里有点难过，他大胆地向国王提出了一个请求：
"I should like to see a sunset… do me that kindness… Order the sun to set…"	“我想看日落，请求您……命令太阳落山吧……”
"If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?" the king demanded. "The general, or myself?"	国王说道：“如果我命令一个将军象一只蝴蝶那样从这朵花飞到那朵花，或者命令他写作一个悲剧剧本或者变一只海鸟，而如果这位将军接到命令不执行的话，那么，是他不对还是我不对呢？”
"Exactly. One much require from each one the duty which each one can perform," the king went on. "Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable."	“一点也不错，”国王接着说，“向每个人提出的要求应该是他们所能做到的。权威首先应该建立在理性的基础上。如果命令你的老百姓去投海，他们非起来革命不可。我的命令是合理的，所以我有权要别人服从。”
"Then my sunset?" the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot a question once he had asked it.	“那么我提出的日落呢？”小王子一旦提出一个问题，他是不会忘记这个问题的。
"You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But, according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are favorable."	“日落么，你会看到的。我一定要太阳落山，不过按照我的统治科学，我得等到条件成熟的时候。”
"Hum! Hum!" replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac. "Hum! Hum! That will be about-- about-- that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed."	国王在回答之前，首先翻阅了一本厚厚的日历，嘴里慢慢说道：“嗯！嗯！日落大约……大约……在今晚七时四十分的时候！你将看到我的命令一定会被服从的。”
The little prince yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset.	小王子又打起哈欠来了。他遗憾没有看到日落。
"Oh, but I have looked already!" said the little prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet. On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all…	“噢！可是我已经看过了。”小王子说道，并探身朝星球的那一侧看了看。那边也没有一个人……
"Then you shall judge yourself," the king answered. "that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom."	“那么你就审判你自己呀！”国王回答他说。“这可是最难的了。审判自己比审判别人要难得多啊！你要是能审判好自己，你就是一个真正有才智的人。”
"I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat. I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. Thus his life will depend on your justice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily. He is the only one we have."	“我想，在我的星球上有一只老耗子。夜里，我听见它的声音。你可以审判它，不时地判处它死刑。因此它的生命取决于你的判决。可是，你要有节制地使用这只耗子，每次判刑后都要赦免它，因为只有这一只耗子。”
"I," replied the little prince, "do not like to condemn anyone to death. And now I think I will go on my way."	“可是我不愿判死刑，我想我还是应该走。”小王子回答道
"If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed," he said, "he should be able to give me a reasonable order. He should be able, for example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute. It seems to me that conditions are favorable…"	“如果国王陛下想要不折不扣地得到服从，你可以给我下一个合理的命令。比如说，你可以命令我，一分钟之内必须离开。我认为这个条件是成熟的……”
As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment. Then, with a sigh, he took his leave.	国王什么也没有回答。起初，小王子有些犹疑不决，随后叹了口气，就离开了。
"The grown-ups are very strange," the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey.	小王子在旅途中自言自语地说：“这些大人真奇怪。”
I nodded my head quickly, but with a little intimidation. He had a lot of power behind his words and smile.	我快速地点点头，心里有点儿忐忑，在他的微笑和话语后面似乎隐藏着一股很强的力量。
"OK, here's my offer. I'll teach you, but I won't do it classroom-style. You work for me, I'll teach you. You don't work for me, I won't teach you. I can teach you faster if you work, and I'm wasting my time if you just want to sit and listen, like you do in school. That's my offer. Take it or leave it."	“好，这就是我的建议：由我来教你们赚钱，但我不会像在教室里教学生那样教你们，你们得为我工作，否则我就不教。因为通过工作我可以更快地教会你们，如果你们只想坐着听讲，就像在学校里那样的话，那我就是在浪费时间了。怎么样？小伙子们，这就是我的建议，你们可以接受也可以拒绝”。
"No. Take it or leave it. I've got too much work to do to waste my time. If you can't make up you mind decisively, then you'll never learn to make money anyway. Opportunities come and go. Being able to know when to make quick decisions is an important skill. You have an opportunity that you asked for. School is beginning or it's over in ten seconds," Mike's dad said with a teasing smile.	“不能，你只能告诉我是接受还是拒绝。因为我有太多的事要做，不能浪费时间。如果你不能下定决心，就永远也学不会如何赚钱。要知道，机会总是转瞬即逝，要想成功必须迅速作出决定。你看，现在你有一个你想要的机会，但这个赚钱学校可以在10秒钟内开学或者关门，那么你……。”迈克的爸爸微笑着看着我们，却并没有说下去。
"Good," said Mike's dad. "Mrs. Martin will be by in ten minutes. After I'm through with her, you ride with her to my superette and you can begin working. I'll pay you 10 cents an hour and you will work for three hours every Saturday."	“好！”迈克的爸爸说道，“马丁夫人会在几分钟内到达。等我和她办完事后，你们跟她去我的杂货店，你们可以在那儿开始工作了。我每小时付给你们10美分，你们每周六来工作3个小时。”
Mike's dad lowered his voice to a stern tone. "Take it or leave it," he said.	迈克的爸爸降低声调严厉地说：“接受或者拒绝。”
"I'll take it," I replied, choosing to work and learn instead of playing softball.	“我接受。”我赶忙回答，我决定去工作和学习而不去打棒球了。
My educated poor dad told me to demand what I deserve. At least 25 cents an hour. My poor dad told me that if I did not get a raise, I was to quit immediately.	我那受过高等教育的穷爸爸要我去争取应有的待遇，每小时至少25美分。爸爸说如果我得不到加薪，就应该立即退出。
"You don't need that damned job anyway," said my poor dad with indignity.	爸爸气愤地说：“你根本不需要那份该死的工作。”
At 8 o'clock Saturday morning, I was going through the same rickety door of Mike's house.	星期六早上8点，我又穿过了迈克家那扇摇晃着的大门。
"Take a seat and wait in line," Mike's dad said as I entered. He turned and disappeared into his little office next to a bedroom.	“坐下等着。”迈克的爸爸在我进门时对我说，说完便转身消失在他那卧室边的小办公室里。
I looked around the room and did not see Mike anywhere. Feeling awkward, I cautiously sat down next to the same two women who where there four weeks earlier. They smiled and slid across the couch to make room for me.	我四下看看，没发现迈克，我感到有些局促，小心地坐到了沙发上，四个星期前见过的那两个女人笑着给我挪出了点地方。
Forty-five minutes went by, and I was steaming. The two women had met with him and left thirty minutes earlier. An older gentleman was in there for twenty minutes and was also gone.	45分钟过去了，我开始冒火，那两个女人已经在30分钟前会见完毕离开了。那个老绅士在呆了20分钟后，也办完事走了。
The house was empty, and I sat out in his musty dark living room on a beautiful sunny Hawaiian day, waiting to talk to a cheapskate who exploited children. I could hear him rustling around the office, talking on the phone, and ignoring me. I was now ready to walk out, but for some reason I stayed.	那天夏威夷阳光灿烂，外边时不时地传来大人、孩子嬉戏的笑声，而我却仍在那幢陈旧黑暗的屋子里坐着，等候一个剥削童工的小商人的召见。我能听见他在办公室里沙沙地走动、打电话，但就是不理我。我真的想出去了，但不知为什么我没有走。
Finally, fifteen minutes later, at exactly 9 o'clock, rich dad walked out of his office, said nothing, and signaled with his hand for me to enter his dingy office.	又过了15分钟，正好9点，富爸爸终于走出了他的办公室。他什么也没说，用手示意要我跟着他去那间小办公室。
"I understand you want a raise or you're going to quit," rich dad said as he swiveled in his office chair.	“你要求加薪，否则你就不干了，是吗？”他边说边在椅子里摇来摇去。
"Well, you're not keeping your end of the bargain," I blurted out nearly in tears. It was really frightening for a 9-year-old boy to confront a grownup.	“你不讲信用！”我脱口而出，眼泪差点掉下来。这样的事对一个9岁的小男孩来说是觉得挺委屈的。
"You said that you would teach me if I worked for you. Well, I've worked for you. I've worked hard. I've given up my baseball games to work for you. And you don't keep your word. You haven't taught me anything. You are a crook like everyone in town thinks you are. You're greedy. You want all the money and don't take care of your employees. You make me wait and don't show me any respect. I'm only a little boy, and I deserve to be treated better."	“你说过如果我为你工作，你就会教我。好，我给你干活，我工作努力，我甚至放弃了棒球比赛来为你工作，而你却说话不算数，你什么也没教我！就像镇上每个人说的那样，你言而无信，还贪心。你想要所有的钱而毫不关心你的雇员。此外，你一点儿也不尊重我，让我等了这么久。我只是个小孩，我应该得到优待！”
Rich dad rocked back in his swivel chair, hands up to his chin, somewhat staring at me. It was like he was studying me.	富爸爸在摇椅里向后一靠，手摸着下巴盯着我，好像在研究我。
"Not bad," he said. "In less than a month, you sound like most of my employees."	“不错，”他说，“还不到1个月，你已经有点像我的其他雇员了。”
"What?" I asked. Not understanding what he was saying, I continued with my grievance. "I thought you were going to keep your end of the bargain and teach me. Instead you want to torture me? That's cruel. That's really cruel."	“什么？”我问。我并未听明白他的话，心里更加气愤不已。“我想你会如约教我，然而你却想折磨我？这太残忍了，真的太残忍了！”
"What have you taught me? Nothing!" I said angrily. "You haven't even talked to me once since I agreed to work for peanuts. Ten cents an hour. Hah! I should notify the government about you. We have child labor laws, you know. My dad works for the government, you know."	“你教我什么了？什么也没有！”我生气极了，“自从我为那几个小钱干活以来，你甚至没和我说过话！10美分1小时！哈，我应该到政府那儿告你！你知道，我们有《童工法》，我爸可是为政府工作的。”
"Wow!" said rich dad. "Now you sound just like most of the people who used to work for me. People I've either fired or they've quit."	“哇！”富爸爸叫道：“现在你看上去就像大多数给我干过活的人了，他们要么被解雇要么辞职不干了。‘”
"So what do you have to say?" I demanded, feeling pretty brave for a little kid. "You lied to me. I've worked for you, and you have not kept your word. You haven't taught me anything."	“你还有什么要说的？”我说道。作为一个小孩，我觉得自己很有勇气。“你骗了我，我为你工作，而你却不守信用，你什么也没教我”。
"How do you know that I've not taught you anything?" asked rich dad calmly.	“你怎么知道我什么都没教你？”富爸爸仍然平静地问我。
"Well, you've never talked to me. I've worked for three weeks, and you have not taught me anything," I said with a pout.	“你从不和我说话，我给你干了三个星期，而你什么也没教给我。”我撅着嘴说。
"That's how they teach you in school," he said smiling. "But that is not how life teaches you, and I would say that life is the best teacher of all. Most of the time, life does not talk to you. It just sort of pushes you around. Each push is life saying, Wake up. There's something I want you to learn.' "	“那是学校教你们的法子，”他笑着说，“但生活可不是这样的教法。你知道吗，生活才是最好的老师，大多数时候，生活并不对你说些什么，它只是推着你转，每一次推，它都像是在说‘喂，醒一醒，有些东西我想让你学学’”。
"What is this man talking about?" I asked myself silently. "Life pushing me around was life talking to me?" Now I knew I had to quit my job. I was talking to someone who needed to be locked up.	“这家伙在说些什么？”我暗自问自己。“生活推着我转就是生活在对我说话？”现在我知道我必须辞职了，我正在和一个应该被关进精神病院的家伙说话。
"If you learn life's lessons, you will do well. If not, life will just continue to push you around. People do two things. Some just let life push them around. Others get angry and push back. But they push back against their boss, or their job, or their husband or wife. They do not know it's life that's pushing."	但富爸爸仍在说：“假如你弄懂了生活这门大课，做任何事情你都会游刃有余。但就算你学不会，生活照样会推着你转。所以生活中，人们通常会做两件事。一些人在生活推着他转的同时，抓住生活赐予的每个机会；而另一些人则听任生活的摆布，不去与生活抗争。他们埋怨生活的不公平，因此就去讨厌老板，讨厌工作，讨厌家人，他们不知道生活也赐予了他们机会。”
"Life pushes all of us around. Some give up. Others fight. A few learn the lesson and move on. They welcome life pushing them around. To these few people, it means they need and want to learn something. They learn and move on. Most quit, and a few like you fight."	“生活推着我们所有的人，有些人放弃了，有些人在抗争。学会了这一课的少数人会进步，他们欢迎生活来积极地推动他们，对他们来说，这种推动意味着他们又可以去学习一些新的东西，然后再进步。当然，大多数人还是放弃了，一部分人像你一样还在抗争。”
Rich dad stood and shut the creaky old wooden window that needed repair. "If you learn this lesson, you will grow into a wise, wealthy and happy young man. If you don't, you will spend your life blaming a job, low pay or your boss for your problems. You'll live life hoping for that big break that will solve all your money problems."	富爸爸站起来，推开那扇破旧失修的窗子，“如果你学会了这一课，你就会成为一个智慧、快乐而富有的人。如果你没有学会，你就只会终生抱怨工作、报怨低报酬和难以相处的老板，你会生活在一劳永逸地把你所有的钱的问题都解决的幻想中。”
Rich dad looked over at me to see if I was still listening. His eyes met mine. We stared at each other, streams of communication going between us through our eyes. Finally, I pulled away once I had absorbed his last message. I knew he was right. I was blaming him, and I did ask to learn. I was fighting.	富爸爸抬眼看我是否在听。他的眼光与我相遇，我们互相对视着，通过眼睛互相交流着，最后，当我接收了他全部的信息后，我将眼睛转开了。我知道他是对的，我需要向他学习。
Rich dad continued. "Or if you're the kind of person who has no guts, you just give up every time life pushes you. If you're that kind of person, you'll live all your life playing it safe, doing the right things, saving yourself for some event that never happens. Then, you die a boring old man. You'll have lots of friends who really like you because you were such a nice hard-working guy. You spent a life playing it safe, doing the right things. But the truth is, you let life push you into submission. Deep down you were terrified of taking risks. You really wanted to win, but the fear of losing was greater than the excitement of winning. Deep inside, you and only you will know you didn't go for it. You chose to play it safe."	富爸爸继续说：“如果你是那种没有毅力的人，你将放弃生活对你的每一次推动。这样的话，你的一生会过得稳稳当当，不做错事、随时准备着当永远不会发生的事情发生时解救自己，然后，在无聊中老死。你会有许多像你一样的朋友，希望生活稳定、处世无误。但事实是，你对生活屈服了，不敢承担风险。你的确想赢，但失去的恐惧超过了成功的兴奋，事实是从内心深处，你就始终认为你不可能赢，所以你选择了稳定。”
Our eyes met again. For ten seconds, we looked at each other, only pulling away once the message was received.	我们的眼光又相遇了。十秒钟之久，我们互相注视着，直到相互明白了对方的心意。
"Dad, Can You Tell Me How to Get Rich?" My dad put down the evening paper. "Why do you want to get rich, son?" "Because today Jimmy's mom drove up in their new Cadillac, and they were going to their beach house for the weekend. He took three of his friends, but Mike and I weren't invited. They told us we weren't invited because we were 'poor kids'."	“爸，你能告诉我怎样才能变得富有吗？”爸爸放下手中的晚报，问：“你为什么想变得富有呢，儿子？”“因为这个周末基米的妈妈会开一辆新的卡迪拉克带基米去海滨别墅度周末。基米还说要带三个朋友去，但我和迈克没有被邀请，他们说我们不被邀请是因为我们是穷孩子。”
I replied in a hurt tone.	我带着一种受到伤害的声调答道。
My dad silently shook his head, pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and went back to reading the paper. I stood waiting for an answer.	爸爸沉默地摇了摇头，把他的眼镜往鼻梁上推了推，然后又去读报纸了。我站在那儿期待着答案。
The year was 1956. I was 9 years old. By some twist of fate, I attended the same public school where the rich people sent their kids. We were primarily a sugar plantation town. The managers of the plantation and the other affluent people of the town, such as doctors, business owners, and bankers, sent their children to this school, grades 1 to 6. After grade 6, their children were generally sent off to private schools. Because my family lived on one side of the street, I went to this school. Had I lived on the other side of the street, I would have gone to a different school, with kids from families more like mine.	那年是1956年，我9岁。由于命运的安排，我进了一所公立学校，许多富人把他们的孩子也送到那所学校。我们镇基本上是个糖料种植场，种植场的经理和其他富裕的人，比如医生、商人、银行家都把孩子送进了这所学校，一到六年级都有。六年级之后他们的孩子通常会被送进私立学校。因为我家就在这个街区，所以我也进了这所学校。如果我家住在街的另一边，或许我会去另外一所学校，和那些家庭背景与我差不多的孩子们在一起了。
After grade 6, these kids and I would go on to the public intermediate and high school. There was no private school for them or for me.	并且六年级之后，我会和那些孩子一道去上公立的中学和高中，因为没有为我们这类孩子设立的私立中学。
My dad finally put down the paper. I could tell he was thinking. 	爸爸终于放下了报纸，我敢说他刚才一定是在思考我的话。
"Well, son," he began slowly. "If you want to be rich, you have to learn to make money."	“哦，儿子，”他慢慢地开口了，“如果你想变得富有，你就必须学会挣钱。”
"Well, use your head, son," he said, smiling. Which really meant, "That's all I'm going to tell you," or "I don't know the answer, so don't embarrass me."	“用你的头脑，儿子。”他说着，并微笑了一下，这种微笑意味着“这就是我要告诉你的全部”，或者“我不知道答案，别为难我了”。
The next morning, I told my best friend, Mike, what my dad had said. As best I could tell, Mike and I were the only poor kids in this school. Mike was like me in that he was in this school by a twist of fate. Someone had drawn a jog in the line for the school district, and we wound up in school with the rich kids. We weren't really poor, but we felt as if we were because all the other boys had new baseball gloves, new bicycles, new everything.	第二天一早，我就把爸爸的话告诉了我最好的朋友迈克。迈克和我可以说是学校里仅有的两个穷孩子。他和我一样由于命运的捉弄而进了这所学校。其实我们俩的家里并不是真的很穷，但我们感觉我们很穷，因为其他的男孩都有新棒球手套、新自行车，他们的东西都是新的。
Mom and dad provided us with the basics, like food, shelter, clothes. But that was about it. My dad used to say, "If you want something, work for it." We wanted things, but there was not much work available for 9-year-old boys.	妈妈和爸爸也为我们提供了基本生活品，像吃的、戴的、穿的，什么都不缺，但也仅此而已。我爸爸常说：“想要什么东西，自己挣钱买。”我们想要东西，但的确没有什么工作可以提供给像我们这样大的9岁男孩。
"I don't know," I said. "But do you want to be my partner?"	“我不知道，”我说，“你想做我的合伙人吗？”
He agreed and so on that Saturday morning, Mike became my first business partner. We spent all morning coming up with ideas on how to make money. Occasionally we talked about all the "cool guys" at Jimmy's beach house having fun. It hurt a little, but that hurt was good, for it inspired us to keep thinking of a way to make money. Finally, that afternoon, a bolt of lightning came through our heads. It was an idea Mike had gotten from a science book he had read. Excitedly, we shook hands, and the partnership now had a business.	于是，就在那个星期六的早晨，迈克成了我的第一个业务伙伴。我们花了整整一个上午去想挣钱的法子，其间常常不由自主地谈起那些“冷酷的家伙”正在基米家的海滨别墅里玩乐。这实在有些伤人，但却是好事，它刺激我们继续努力去想挣钱的法子。最后，到了下午，一个念头在我们的头脑中闪过，这是迈克从以前读过的一本科普书里得到的主意。我们兴奋地握手，现在我们的合伙关系终于有了业务。
For the next several weeks, Mike and I ran around our neighborhood, knocking on doors and asking our neighbors if they would save their toothpaste tubes for us. With puzzled looks, most adults consented with a smile. Some asked us what we were doing. To which we replied, "We can't tell you. It's a business secret."	在接下来的几星期里，迈克和我跑遍了邻近各家，敲开他们的门问他们是否愿意把用过的牙膏皮攒下来给我们。迷惑不解的大人们微笑着答应了，有的问我们要它做什么，对此我们回答道：“这是商业秘密”。
My mom grew distressed as the weeks wore on. We had selected a site next to her washing machine as the place we would stockpile our raw materials. In a brown cardboard box that one time held catsup bottles, our little pile of used toothpaste tubes began to grow.	几星期过去了，我妈变得心烦起来，因为我们选了一个靠近她洗衣机的地方放置我们的原料。在一个曾用来盛番茄酱的大罐子里，积攒在那儿的用过的牙膏皮正在慢慢变多。
Finally my mom put her foot down. The sight of her neighbors' messy, crumpled used toothpaste tubes had gotten to her. "What are you boys doing?" she asked. "And I don't want to hear again that it's a business secret. Do something with this mess or I'm going to throw it out."	看到邻居们脏乱、卷曲的废牙膏皮都到了她这儿，妈妈最后采取了行动。“你们两个到底想要干什么？”她问，“我不想再听到‘商业秘密’之类的话，赶快处理掉这些东西，否则我就会把它们全扔出去！”
Mike and I pleaded and begged, explaining that we would soon have enough and then we would begin production. We informed her that we were waiting on a couple of neighbors to finish using up their toothpaste so we could have their tubes. Mom granted us a one-week extension.	迈克和我苦苦哀求，说我们已经快攒够了，只等一对邻居夫妇用完他们的牙膏后，我们就可以马上开始生产了。经过一番口舌，最后妈妈给了我们一周的延期。
The date to begin production was moved up. The pressure was on. My first partnership was already being threatened with an eviction notice from our warehouse space by my own mom. It became Mike's job to tell the neighbors to quickly use up their toothpaste, saying their dentist wanted them to brush more often anyway. I began to put together the production line.	来自妈妈的压力使我们的生产日期提前了。我的第一桩生意，由于货仓收到了妈妈的逐客令而出现危机，迈克的任务变成了告诉邻居们快些用完他们的牙膏，告诉他们牙医希望他们比平常更多地刷牙，我则开始组装生产线。按照时间表，生产将于一星期后正式开始。开始生产的日子终于到了。
Dad walked up cautiously, having to park the car at the base of the driveway, since the production line blocked the carport. As he and his friend got closer, they saw a steel pot sitting on top of the coals, with the toothpaste tubes being melted down. In those days, toothpaste did not come in plastic tubes. The tubes were made of lead. So once the paint was burned off, the tubes were dropped in the small steel pot, melted until they became liquid, and with my mom's pot holders we were pouring the lead through a small hole in the top of the milk cartons.	爸爸小心地走过来，由于生产线挡住了车位他不得不把车停在路边。当他和他朋友走近时，他们看见一个钢壶架在炭上，里面的废牙膏皮正在熔化。在那个时候，牙膏皮还不是塑料做的，而是铅制的。所以一旦牙膏皮上的涂料被烧掉后，被放在钢壶中的铅皮就会烧熔，直到变成液体。当铅皮到达熔点时，我们就用妈妈的抓锅布垫着，将溶液从牛奶盒顶的小孔中小心地注入到牛奶盒中。
The milk cartons were filled with plaster-of-Paris. The white powder everywhere was the plaster before we mixed it with water. In my haste, I had knocked the bag over, and the entire area look like it had been hit by a snowstorm. The milk cartons were the outer containers for plaster-of-Paris molds.	牛奶盒里装满了熟石膏，满地的白色粉末是我们将灰和水混和时弄的，由于我一时匆忙，打翻了小包，所以弄得到处是白灰，好似下了场雪。牛奶盒就是石灰模的外部容器。
My dad and his friend watched as we carefully poured the molten lead through a small hole in the top of the plaster-of-Paris cube.	爸爸和他的朋友注视着我们小心翼翼地把熔铅注入到灰管顶部的小孔中。
Finally, once the pouring was through, I put the steel pot down and smiled at my dad.	最后，当溶液全部倒入石灰模后，我放下钢壶；向老爸绽开了笑脸。
"We're doing what you told me to do. We're going to be rich," I said.	“我们正在按你告诉我的话做，我们就要变成富人了！”我说。
"Yup," said Mike, grinning and nodding his head. "We're partners."	“是的，”迈克咧嘴笑着点头说道：“我们是合伙人。”
"And what is in those plaster molds?" dad asked.	“这些灰模子里面是什么东西？”老爸有些好奇地问。
With a small hammer, I tapped at the seal that divided the cube in half. Cautiously, I pulled up the top half of the plaster mold and a lead nickel fell out."	我用一个小锤子敲开了密封物并把管子分成两半，我小心地抽掉灰模的上半部，一个铅制的五分硬币便掉了下来。
"Oh, my God!" my dad said. "You're casting nickels out of lead."	“噢，天啊，”老爸叫了起来，用手摸着额头：“你们在用铅造硬币！”
"That's right," Mike said. "We doing as you told us to do. We're making money."	“对啊，”迈克说，“我们按你说的，在自己挣钱呐。”
My dad's friend turned and burst into laughter. My dad smiled and shook his head. Along with a fire and a box of spent toothpaste tubes, in front of him were two little boys covered with white dust and smiling from ear to ear.	爸爸的朋友转过身去爆发出一阵大笑，爸爸则微笑着摇着头。在一堆火和一堆废牙膏皮旁，他面前的两个白灰满面的小男孩正在开心地笑着。
He asked us to put everything down and sit with him on the front step of our house. With a smile, he gently explained what the word "counterfeiting" meant.	爸爸要我们放下手里的东西和他坐到屋外的台阶上，然后他微笑着和蔼地向我们解释了“伪造”一词的含义。
Our dreams were dashed. "You mean this is illegal?" asked Mike in a quivering voice.	我们的梦想破灭了！“你的意思是说这么做是违法的？”迈克用颤抖的声音问。
"Let them go," my dad's friend said. "They might be developing a natural talent."	“别怪他们，”我爸爸的朋友说，“他们也许会成为天才呢。”
"Yes, it is illegal," my dad said gently. "But you boys have shown great creativity and original thought. Keep going. I'm really proud of you!"	“对，这是违法的。”爸爸温和地说，“但是，孩子们，别灰心，我为你们刚才表现出来的巨大的创造性和独立思考精神而感到骄傲。”
Disappointed, Mike and I sat in silence for about twenty minutes before we began cleaning up our mess. The business was over on opening day. Sweeping the powder up, I looked at Mike and said, "I guess Jimmy and his friends are right. We are poor."	失望之中，迈克和我在沉默中坐了20分钟才开始收拾残局。我们的生意在刚开始的第一天就结束了。把粉扫拢时，我望着迈克沮丧地说：“我想基米和他的朋友们是对的，我们只能当穷人了。”
My father was just leaving as I said that. "Boys," he said. "You're only poor if you give up. The most important thing is that you did something. Most people only talk and dream of getting rich. You've done something. I'm very proud of the two of you. I will say it again. Keep going. Don't quit."	爸爸正要离开时听到了这话，“孩子，”他转过身来说，“如果你们放弃了你们才真的只能当穷人了。一件事情的成败并不重要，重要的是你们曾经尝试过。要知道大多数人只是谈论和梦想发财，而你们已经付出了行动。我再说一遍，我为你们骄傲，孩子们，别灰心，别放弃。”
Mike and I stood there in silence. They were nice words, but we still did not know what to do.	迈克和我沉默地站在那儿，话挺对，但我们仍不知应该干些什么。
"Because I chose to be a schoolteacher. Schoolteachers really don't think about being rich. We just like to teach. I wish I could help you, but I really don't know how to make money."	“因为我选择了当中学老师。中学老师要专心教书，不该去想怎么发财。我希望我能帮你们，但我真的不知道如何才能赚大钱。”
"I know," said my dad. "If you boys want to learn how to be rich, don't ask me. Talk to your dad, Mike."	爸接着说：“如果你们希望了解如何致富，不要问我，去和你爸谈谈，迈克。”
I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning. He also had one volcano that was extinct. But, as he said, "One never knows!" So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too. If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.	我想小王子大概是利用一群候鸟迁徙的机会跑出来的。在他出发的那天早上，他把他的星球收拾得整整齐齐，把它上头的活火山打扫得干干净净。他有两个活火山，早上热早点很方便。他还有一座死火山，他也把它打扫干净。他想， 说不定它还会活动呢!打扫干净了，它们就可以慢慢地有规律地燃烧，而不会突然爆发。火山爆发就像烟囱里的火焰一样。
On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes. That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us.	当然，在我们地球上我们人太小，不能打扫火山，所以火山给我们带来很多很多麻烦。
The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would never want to return. But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him. And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realised that he was very close to tears.	小王子还把剩下的最后几棵猴面包树苗全拔了。他有点忧伤。他以为他再也不会回来了。这天，这些家常活使他感到特别亲切。当他最后一次浇花时，准备把她好好珍藏起来。他发觉自己要哭出来。
"I have been silly," she said to him, at last. "I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy…"	她终于对他说道：“我方才真蠢。请你原谅我。希望你能幸福。”
He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness.	花儿对他毫不抱怨，他感到很惊讶。他举着罩子，不知所措地伫立在那里。他不明白她为什么会这样温柔恬静。
"Of course I love you," the flower said to him. "It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But you-- you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy… let the glass globe be. I don't want it any more."	“的确，我爱你。”花儿对他说道：“但由于我的过错，你一点也没有理会。这丝毫不重要。不过，你也和我一样的蠢。希望你今后能幸福……把罩子放在一边吧，我用不着它了。”
"My cold is not so bad as all that… the cool night air will do me good. I am a flower."	“我的感冒并不那么重……夜晚的凉风对我倒有好处。我是一朵花。”
"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very beautiful. And if not the butterflies-- and the caterpillars-- who will call upon me? You will be far away… as for the large animals-- I am not at all afraid of any of them. I have my claws."	“我要是想认识蝴蝶，经不起两三只尺蠖是不行的。据说这是很美的。不然还有谁来看我呢？你就要到远处去了。至于说大动物，我并不怕，我有爪子。”
And she showed her four thorns. Then she added:	于是，她天真地显露出她那四根刺，随后又说道：
"Don't linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!"	“别这么磨蹭了。真烦人！你既然决定离开这儿，那么，快走吧！”
For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower…	她是怕小王子看见她在哭。她是一朵非常骄傲的花……
I had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly educated and intelligent; he had a Ph.D. and completed four years of undergraduate work in less than two years. He then went on to Stanford University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern University to do his advanced studies, all on full financial scholarships. The other father never finished the eighth grade.	我有两个爸爸，一个富，一个穷。一个受过良好的教育，聪明绝顶，拥有博士的光环，他曾经在不到两年的时间里修完了四年制的大学本科学业，随后又在斯坦福大学、芝加哥大学和西北大学进一步深造，并且在所有这些学校都拿到了全奖；与之相反的是，我的另一个爸爸连八年级都没能念完。
Both men were successful in their careers, working hard all their lives. Both earned substantial incomes. Yet one struggled financially all his life. The other would become one of the richest men in Hawaii. One died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities and his church. The other left bills to be paid.	应该说两位爸爸的事业都相当成功，而且一辈子都很勤奋，因此，两人都有着丰厚的收入。然而其中一个人终其一生都在个人财务问题的泥沼中挣扎，另一个人则成了夏威夷最富有的人之一。一个爸爸身后为教堂、慈善机构和家人留下数千万美元的巨额遗产，而另一个爸爸却只留下一些待付的账单。
Both men were strong, charismatic and influential. Both men offered me advice, but they did not advise the same things. Both men believed strongly in education but did not recommend the same course of study.	其实我的两个爸爸都是那种生性刚强、富有魅力、对他人有着非凡影响力的人。他们两个人都曾给过我许多建议，但建议的内容却总不相同；他们两人也都深信教育的力量，但向我推荐的课程却从不一样。
If I had had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his advice. Having two dads advising me offered me the choice of contrasting points of view; one of a rich man and one of a poor man.	如果只有一个爸爸，我就只能对他的建议简单地加以接受或者拒绝；而两个爸爸给我截然对立的建议，这在客观上使我有了对比和选择的机会。现在回想起来，这实际上是一种在富人的观念和穷人的观念之间进行的对比和选择，而这种对比和选择的结果决定了我的一生。
Instead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found myself thinking more, comparing and then choosing for myself.	由于两个父亲的观念对立，使我得不到统一的说法，我便无法简单地对这些建议予以接受或拒绝，我发现自己有了更多的思考、比较和选择。
The problem was, the rich man was not rich yet and the poor man not yet poor. Both were just starting out on their careers, and both were struggling with money and families. But they had very different points of view about the subject of money.	问题是，在给我建议的时候，富爸爸还不算富有，而穷爸爸当时也并不贫穷，两人都刚刚开始他们的事业，都在为钱和家庭而奋斗。然而，他们对于钱的理解却是如此的迥然不同。
For example, one dad would say, "The love of money is the root of all evil." The other, "The lack of money is the root of all evil."	这就好像一个爸爸会说：“贪财乃万恶之源”；而另一个爸爸却会说：“贫困才是万恶之本”。
As a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me was difficult. I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers did not say the same things. The contrast in their points of view, particularly where money was concerned, was so extreme that I grew curious and intrigued. I began to start thinking for long periods of time about what each was saying.	他们之中谁会成功？谁会富有？应该听谁的？当时我还只是一个小男孩，对我而言拥有两个同样富有影响力的爸爸可不是一件好应付的事。我想成为一个听话的好孩子，但两个爸爸却说着完全不同的话，他们的观点是如此相修，尤其在涉及到金钱的问题上更是如此，这令我既好奇又迷惑，我不得不花很多时间对他们的话进行思考。
Much of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself questions such as, "Why does he say that?" and then asking the same question of the other dad's statement. It would have been much easier to simply say, "Yeah, he's right. I agree with that." Or to simply reject the point of view by saying, "The old man doesn't know what he's talking about." Instead, having two dads whom I loved forced me to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself. As a process, choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in the long run, rather than simply accepting or rejecting a single point of view.	我用了很多的时间，问自己诸如“他为什么会那样说”之类的问题，然后又对另一个爸爸的话提出同样的疑问。如果不经过自己的思考就简单地说：“噢，他是对的，我同意”，或是拒绝说：“这个老爸不知道自己在说些什么”，我想那会容易得多。然而，这两个我所爱的观点不同的爸爸却迫使我对每一个有分歧的问题进行思考，并最终形成自己的想法。这一过程，即自己去思考和选取而不是简单地全盘接受或全盘否定的过程，在后来的漫长岁月中被证明对我是非常有益的。
One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class struggles in debt is because the subject of money is taught at home, not in school. Most of us learn about money from our parents. So what can a poor parent tell their child about money? They simply say "Stay in school and study hard." The child may graduate with excellent grades but with a poor person's financial programming and mind-set. It was learned while the child was young.	我逐渐意识到富人之所以越来越富，穷人之所以越来越穷，中产阶级之所以总是在债务泥潭中挣扎，其主要原因之一在于他们对金钱的观念不是来自学校，而是来自家庭。我们中的绝大多数人是从父母那里了解钱是怎么回事的。一对贫困的父母在培养孩子的理财观念时，只会说：“在学校里要好好学习喔”。结果，他们的孩子可能会以优异的成绩毕业，但同时也秉承了贫穷父母的理财方式和思维观念——要知道，由于家长的灌输，这些观念在孩子很小的时候就已经开始形成了。
Money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic and professional skills, but not on financial skills. This explains how smart bankers, doctors and accountants who earned excellent grades in school may still struggle financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt is due in large part to highly educated politicians and government officials making financial decisions with little or no training on the subject of money.	据我所知，迄今为止，在美国的学校里仍没有真正开设有关“金钱”的基础课程。学校教育只专注于学术知识和专业技能的教育和培养，却忽视了理财技能的培训。这也解释了为何众多精明的银行家、医生和会计师们在学校时成绩优异，可一辈子还是要为财务问题伤神；国家岌岌可危的债务问题在很大程度上也应归因于那些作出财务决策的政治家和政府官员们，他们中有些人虽然受过高等教育，但却很少甚至几乎没有接受过财务方面的必要培训。
I often look ahead to the new millennium and wonder what will happen when we have millions of people who will need financial and medical assistance. They will be dependent on their families or the government for financial support. What will happen when Medicare and Social Security run out of money? How will a nation survive if teaching children about money continues to be left to parents-most of whom will be, or already are, poor?	我常常在想，当我们的社会有成百万的人需要医疗救助时该怎么办？当然，家人和政府会救济他们。可是，当医疗基金和社会保障基金用尽时又该怎么办？这并非是杞人忧天，如果我们继续把教子理财的重任交给那些由于自身缺乏财务知识，正濒于贫困边线或已陷入贫困境地的父母的话，很难想像仅靠家人和社会的救济能够根治他们的“穷”病，实现整个社会的富裕。
Because I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of them. I had to think about each dad's advice, and in doing so, I gained valuable insight into the power and effect of one's thoughts on one's life. For example, one dad had a habit of saying, "I can't afford it." The other dad forbade those words to be used. He insisted I say, "How can I afford it?" One is a statement, and the other is a question. One lets you off the hook, and the other forces you to think. My soon-to-be-rich dad would explain that by automatically saying the words "I can't afford it," your brain stops working. By asking the question "How can I afford it?" your brain is put to work. He did not mean buy everything you wanted. He was fanatical about exercising your mind, the most powerful computer in the world. "My brain gets stronger every day because I exercise it. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make." He believed that automatically saying "I can't afford it" was a sign of mental laziness.	由于我有两个对我有影响力且可以向其学习的爸爸，迫使我不得不去思考每个爸爸的意见，由此，我认识到一个人的观念对其一生的巨大影响力。例如，一个爸爸爱说“我可付不起”这样的话，而另一个爸爸则禁止用这类话，他会说：“我怎样才能付得起呢？”这两句话，一个是陈述句，另一个是疑问句，一个让你放弃，而另一个则促使你去想办法。那很快就致富的爸爸解释道，说“我付不起”这种话会阻止你去开动脑筋想办法；而问“怎样才能付得起”则开动了你的大脑。当然，这并不意味着人们必须去买每一件你想要的东西，这里只是强调要不停地锻炼你的思维——实际上人的大脑是世界上最棒的“计算机”。富爸爸时常说：“脑袋越用越活，脑袋越活，挣钱就越多”。在他看来，轻易就说“我负担不起”这类话是一种精神上的懒惰。
Although both dads worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a habit of putting his brain to sleep when it came to money matters, and the other had a habit of exercising his brain. The long-term result was that one dad grew stronger financially and the other grew weaker. It is not much different from a person who goes to the gym to exercise on a regular basis versus someone who sits on the couch watching television. Proper physical exercise increases your chances for health, and proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth. Laziness decreases both health and wealth.	虽然两个爸爸工作都很努力，但我注意到，当遇到钱的问题时，一个爸爸总会去想办法解决，而另一个爸爸则习惯于顺其自然。长期下来，一个爸爸的理财能力更强了，而另一个的理财能力则越来越弱。我想这种结果类似于一个经常去健身房锻炼的人与一个总是坐在沙发上看电视的人在体质上的变化。经常性的体育锻炼可以强身健体，同样地，经常性的头脑运动可以增加你获得财富的机会。懒惰必定会使你的体质变弱、财富减少。
My two dads had opposing attitudes in thought. One dad thought that the rich should pay more in taxes to take care of those less fortunate. The other said, "Taxes punish those who produce and reward those who don't produce."	就像我前面所说的，我的两个爸爸存在着很多观念上的差异。一个爸爸认为富人应该缴更多的税去照顾那些比较不幸的人；另一个爸爸则说：“税是惩勤奖懒”。
One dad recommended, "Study hard so you can find a good company to work for." The other recommended, "Study hard so you can find a good company to buy."	一个爸爸说：“努力学习能去好公司工作”；而另一个则会说：“努力学习能发现并将有能力收购好公司”。
One dad said, "The reason I'm not rich is because I have you kids." The other said, "The reason I must be rich is because I have you kids."	一个说：“我不富的原因是我有孩子”；另一个则说：“我必须富的原因是我有孩子”。
One encouraged talking about money and business at the dinner ,table. The other forbade the subject of money to be discussed over a meal.	一个禁止在晚饭桌上谈论钱和生意，另一个则鼓励在吃饭时谈论这些话题。
One said, "When it comes to money, play it safe, don't take risks." The other said, "Learn to manage risk."	一个说：“挣钱的时候要小心，别去冒险”；另一个则说：“要学会管理风险”。
One believed, "Our home is our largest investment and our greatest asset." The other believed, "My house is a liability, and if your house is your largest investment, you're in trouble."	一个相信“我们家的房子是我们最大的投资和资产”，另一个则相信“我们家的房子是负债，如果你的房子是你最大的投资，你就有麻烦了”。
Both dads paid their bills on time, yet one paid his bills first while the other paid his bills last.	两个爸爸都会准时付账，但不同的是：一个在期初支付，另一个则在期末支付。
I soon learned to know this flower better. On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet. It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.	很快我就进一步了解了这朵花儿。在小王子的星球上，过去一直都生长着一 些只有一层花瓣的很简单的花。这些花非常小，一点也不占地方，从来也不会去打搅任何人。她们早晨在草丛中开放，晚上就凋谢了。不知从哪里来了一颗种子， 忽然一天这种子发了芽。小王子特别仔细地监视着这棵与众不同的小苗：这玩艺说不定是一种新的猴面包树。
The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colours with the greatest care. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days.	这小苗不久就不再长了，而且开始孕育着一个花朵。看到在这棵苗上长出了一个很大很大的花蕾，小王子感觉到从这个花苞中一定会出现一个奇迹。然而这朵花藏在它那绿茵茵的房间中用了很长的时间来打扮自己。她精心选择着她将来的颜色，慢慢腾腾地妆饰着，一片片地搭配着她的花瓣，她不愿象虞美人那样一出世就满脸皱纹。她要让自己带着光艳夺目的丽姿来到世间。是的，她是非常爱俏的。她用好些好些日子天仙般地梳妆打扮。
Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.	然后，在一天的早晨，恰好在太阳升起的时候，她开放了。
And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said:	她已经精细地做了那么长的准备工作，却打着哈欠说道：
"Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged…"	“我刚刚睡醒，真对不起，瞧我的头发还是乱蓬蓬的……”
"Am I not?" the flower responded, sweetly. "And I was born at the same moment as the sun…"	花儿悠然自得地说：“是吧，我是与太阳同时出生的……”
"I think it is time for breakfast," she added an instant later. "If you would have the kindness to think of my needs--"	她随后又说道：“现在该是吃早点的时候了吧，请你也想着给我准备一点——”
And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower.	小王子很有些不好意思，于是就拿着喷壶，打来了一壶清清的凉水，浇灌着花儿。
"There are no tigers on my planet," the little prince objected. "And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds."	小王子顶了她一句：“在我这个星球上没有老虎，而且，老虎是不会吃草的”。
Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same.	于是花儿放开嗓门咳嗽了几声，依然要使小王子后悔自己的过失。
So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.	尽管小王子本来诚心诚意地喜欢这朵花，可是，这一来，却使他马上对她产生了怀疑。小王子对一些无关紧要的话看得太认真，结果使自己很苦恼。
"I ought not to have listened to her," he confided to me one day. "One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity."	有一天他告诉我说：“我不该听信她的话，绝不该听信那些花儿的话，看看花，闻闻它就得了。我的那朵花使我的星球芳香四溢，可我不会享受它。关于老虎爪子的事，本应该使我产生同情，却反而使我恼火。”
"The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her… I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little strategems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her…"	“我那时什么也不懂!我应该根据她的行为，而不是根据她的话来判断她。 她使我的生活芬芳多彩，我真不该离开她跑出来。我本应该猜出在她那令人爱怜的花招后面所隐藏的温情。花是多么自相矛盾!我当时太年轻，还不懂得爱她。”
Books are indispensable partners in our life journey. Everyone has several favorite books and people's tastes may vary by age. A photographer captured reading enthusiasts ranging from 10 years old to 90 years old and talked with them about their favorite books. As time advances, people's way of reading may change, but the enjoyment from reading never changes.	图书是我们生命旅程中不可或缺的伙伴。每个人都有几本最爱的图书，而随着年龄的增长，读书的口味也在发生变化。一位摄影师拍摄了几位阅读爱好者，让他们谈了谈最爱的图书，他们当中有的人年仅10岁，有的已经90岁高龄。随着时代的前行，人们的阅读方式会改变，但阅读的乐趣不会变。
A few months ago I was nominated for Governor of the great state of New York, to run against Mr. John T. Smith and Mr. Blank J. Blank on an independent ticket. I somehow felt that I had one prominent advantage over these gentlemen, and that was--good character. It was easy to see by the newspapers that if ever they had known what it was to bear a good name, that time had gone by. It was plain that in these latter years they had become familiar with all manner of shameful crimes. But at the very moment that I was exalting my advantage and joying in it in secret, there was a muddy undercurrent of discomfort "riling" the deeps of my happiness, and that was--the having to hear my name bandied about in familiar connection with those of such people. I grew more and more disturbed. Finally I wrote my grandmother about it. Her answer came quick and sharp. She said:	几个月以前，我被提名为独立党的纽约州州长候选人，与斯图阿特-伍德福先生和约翰-霍夫曼先生竞选。我总觉得我有一个显著的长处胜过这两位先生，那就是——声望还好。从报纸上很容易看出，即令他们曾经知道保持名誉的好处，那个时候也已经过去了。近几年来，他们显然对各式各样可耻的罪行都习以为常了。但是正当我还在赞美自己的长处，并因此暗自得意的时候，却有一股不愉快的浑浊潜流“搅浑”我那快乐心情的深处，那就是——不得不听到我的名字动辄被人家拿来与那些人相提并论地到处传播。我心里越来越烦乱。后来我就写信给我的祖母，报告这桩事情。她的信回得又快又干脆。她说：
You have never done one single thing in all your life to be ashamed of--not one. Look at the newspapers--look at them and comprehend what sort of characters Messrs. Smith and Blank are, and then see if you are willing to lower yourself to their level and enter a public canvass with them.	你生平从来没有干过一桩可羞的事情——从来没有。你看看报纸吧——你看一看，要明白伍德福和霍夫曼这两位先生是一种什么人物，然后想一想你是否情愿把自己降到他们的水平，和他们公开竞选。
It was my very thought! I did not sleep a single moment that night. But, after all, I could not recede.	我也正是这么想呀！那天晚上我片刻也没有睡着。可是事已至此，我究竟无法撒手了。
I was fully committed, and must go on with the fight. As I was looking listlessly over the papers at breakfast I came across this paragraph, and I may truly say I never was so confounded before.	我已经完全卷入了漩涡，不得不继续这场斗争。早餐时，我无精打采地看着报纸，忽然发现下面这么一段。老实说，我从来没有那么吃惊过。
PERJURY.--Perhaps, now that Mr. Mark Twain is before the people as a candidate for Governor, he will condescend to explain how he came to be convicted of perjury by thirty-four witnesses in Wakawak, Cochin China, in 1863, the intent of which perjury being to rob a poor native widow and her helpless family of a meager plantain-patch, their only stay and support in their bereavement and desolation. Mr. Twain owes it to himself, as well as to the great people whose suffrages he asks, to clear this matter up. Will he do it?	伪证罪——马克-吐温先生现在既然在大众面前当了州长候选人，他也许会赏个面子，说明一下他怎么会在一八六三年在交趾支那瓦卡瓦克被三十四个证人证明犯了伪证罪。那次做伪证的意图是要从一个贫苦的土著寡妇及其无依无靠的儿女手里夺取一块贫瘠的香蕉园，那是他们失去亲人之后的凄凉生活中惟一的依靠和惟一的生活来源。吐温先生应该把这桩事情交代清楚，才对得起他自己，才对得起他所要求投票支持他的广大人民。他是否会照办呢？
I thought I should burst with amazement! Such a cruel, heartless charge! I never had seen Cochin China! I never had heard of Wakawak! I didn't know a plantain-patch from a kangaroo! I did not know what to do. I was crazed and helpless. I let the day slip away without doing anything at all. The next morning the same paper had this--nothing more:	我觉得我简直诧异得要爆炸了，这样残酷无情的诬蔑！我一辈子连见也没有见过交趾支那！瓦卡瓦克我连听也没有听说过！至于香蕉园，我简直就不知道它和一只袋鼠有什么区别！我真不知道怎么办才好。我简直弄得神经错乱，不知所措。我只好把那一天混过去，根本就没有采取任何步骤。第二天早上，同一报纸上登着这么一条——别的什么也没有：
SIGNIFICANT.--Mr. Twain, it will be observed, is suggestively silent about the Cochin China perjury.	耐人寻味——大家都会注意到，吐温先生对于那桩交趾支那的伪证案保持缄默，似有隐衷。
[Mem.--During the rest of the campaign this paper never referred to me in any other way than as "the infamous perjurer Twain."]	（附注——从此以后，在竞选运动期中，这个报纸一提到我，惟一的称呼就始终是“无耻的伪证制造者吐温”。）
Could anything be more deliberately malicious than that? For I never was in Montana in my life.	世间还能有比这更居心险恶的事情吗？我是一辈子没有到过蒙大拿的。
[After this, this journal customarily spoke of me as, "Twain, the Montana Thief."]	（从此以后，这个报纸就照例把我叫做“蒙大拿的小偷吐温”。）
I got to picking up papers apprehensively--much as one would lift a desired blanket which he had some idea might have a rattlesnake under it. One day this met my eye:	于是我渐渐对报纸有了戒心，一拿起来就觉得提心吊胆——很像一个人想睡觉的时候去揭开床毯，可是脑子里却担心那底下会有一条响尾蛇似的。有一天，我又看到这么一段：
THE LIE NAILED.--By the sworn affidavits of Michael O'Flanagan, Esq., of the Five Points, and Mr. Snub Rafferty and Mr. Catty Mulligan, of Water Street, it is established that Mr. Mark Twain's vile statement that the lamented grandfather of our noble standard- bearer, Blank J. Blank, was hanged for highway robbery, is a brutal and gratuitous LIE, without a shadow of foundation in fact. It is disheartening to virtuous men to see such shameful means resorted to to achieve political success as the attacking of the dead in their graves, and defiling their honored names with slander. When we think of the anguish this miserable falsehood must cause the innocent relatives and friends of the deceased, we are almost driven to incite an outraged and insulted public to summary and unlawful vengeance upon the traducer. But no! let us leave him to the agony of a lacerated conscience (though if passion should get the better of the public, and in its blind fury they should do the traducer bodily injury, it is but too obvious that no jury could convict and no court punish the perpetrators of the deed).	谣言被揭穿了——根据五点区的迈克尔-欧弗兰纳根先生和水街的启特-柏恩斯先生及约翰-亚伦先生三人宣誓负责的证词，现已证明马克-吐温先生诬蔑我党德高望重的领袖约翰-霍夫曼已故的祖父，说他是因犯盗劫罪被处绞刑的。这种卑鄙的说法是一种下流的无端的谣言，连丝毫事实根据的踪影都没有。像这样毁谤九泉之下的死者并以谰言玷污他们的令名的无耻手段，竟被人用以博得政治上的成功，这实在叫正人君子看了寒心。我们想到这种卑鄙的谣言给死者清白的家属和亲友们必然带来的悲恸时，几乎激动得要把受了污蔑和侮辱的公众鼓动起来，采取断然行动，对诽谤者施行非法的报复。但是我们不这么办！还是让他去受到良心的谴责而苦痛吧。（不过公众如果让感情的冲动占了上风，在盲目的愤怒支配之下竟至对诽谤者加以人身的伤害，显而易见，陪审员是不能给这些激于义愤的人们定罪的，法院也不能对他们加以处罚。）
The ingenious closing sentence had the effect of moving me out of bed with despatch that night, and out at the back door also, while the "outraged and insulted public" surged in the front way, breaking furniture and windows in their righteous indignation as they came, and taking off such property as they could carry when they went. And yet I can lay my hand upon the Book and say that I never slandered Mr. Blank's grandfather. More: I had never even heard of him or mentioned him up to that day and date.	末尾那句巧妙的话居然大起作用，当天夜里就有一群“受了污蔑和侮辱的公众”从我的房子前面冲进来，把我吓得连忙从床上爬起来，由后门逃出去。那些人满腔义愤，来势汹汹，一进门就捣毁了家具和窗户，走的时候把能带走的财物都拿去了。但是我可以把手按在《圣经》上发誓，我从来没有诽谤过霍夫曼州长的祖父。不但如此，直到那一天为止，我还从来没有听说过他，也从来没有提到过他。
[I will state, in passing, that the journal above quoted from always referred to me afterward as "Twain, the Body-Snatcher."]	（我要顺便说一声，从那以后，上面所引的那个报纸就把我称为“盗尸犯吐温”。）
A SWEET CANDIDATE.--Mr. Mark Twain, who was to make such a blighting speech at the mass-meeting of the Independents last night, didn't come to time! A telegram from his physician stated that he had been knocked down by a runaway team, and his leg broken in two places--sufferer lying in great agony, and so forth, and so forth, and a lot more bosh of the same sort. And the Independents tried hard to swallow the wretched subterfuge, and pretend that they did not know what was the real reason of the absence of the abandoned creature whom they denominate their standard-bearer. A certain man was seen to reel into Mr. Twain's hotel last night in a state of beastly intoxication. It is the imperative duty of the Independents to prove that this besotted brute was not Mark Twain himself. We have them at last! This is a case that admits of no shirking. The voice of the people demands in thunder tones, "WHO WAS THAT MAN?"	好一个体面的候选人——马克-吐温先生原定于昨晚在独立党的群众大会上作一次中伤别人的演说，但是他不曾按时到场！他的医生打来了一个电报，说他被一辆狂奔的马车撞倒了，腿上两处受伤——伤者在床上躺着，非常苦痛，如此这般，还编了一大堆这类的谎话。独立党党员们极力要把这种卑鄙的托词信以为真，故意假装着不知道他们所提名为候选人的这个花天酒地的家伙之所以没有来的真正原因。昨晚上分明有人看见一个人醉得不成样子，一歪一倒地走进吐温先生住的旅馆。独立党党员们有不容推卸的义务，应该赶快证明这个醉鬼并非马克-吐温本人。我们终于把他们难住了！这件事情是不容避而不谈的。人民的呼声响雷似的要求回答，“那个人究竟是谁？”
It was incredible, absolutely incredible, for a moment, that it was really my name that was coupled with this disgraceful suspicion. Three long years had passed over my head since I had tasted ale, beer, wine or liquor or any kind.	当真把我的名字牵连到这个不名誉的嫌疑上面，一时实在令人难以置信，绝对难以置信。我已经整整三年没有尝过麦酒、啤酒、葡萄酒或是任何一种酒了。
By this time anonymous letters were getting to be an important part of my mail matter. 	这时候匿名信逐渐成为我所收到的邮件中的重要部分。
Shortly the principal Republican journal "convicted" me of wholesale bribery, and the leading Democratic paper "nailed" an aggravated case of blackmailing to me.	不久，共和党的主要报纸又给我“判了罪”——大规模的贿赂行为；而民主党的权威报纸则将一桩大事渲染的讹诈案硬栽到我头上。
[In this way I acquired two additional names: "Twain the Filthy Corruptionist" and "Twain the Loathsome Embracer."]	（就是这样，我又获得了两个称号：“肮脏的舞弊分子吐温”和“可恶的讹诈者吐温”。）
By this time there had grown to be such a clamor for an "answer" to all the dreadful charges that were laid to me that the editors and leaders of my party said it would be political ruin for me to remain silent any longer. As if to make their appeal the more imperative, the following appeared in one of the papers the very next day:	这时候舆论鼎沸，叫我“答复”对我提出的那一切可怕的控诉，以致我们党里的主笔和领袖们都说我如果再保持缄默，那就会使我在政治上垮台。好像是要使控诉更加显得有劲似的，就在第二天，有一家报纸上又登出了下面这么一段：
BEHOLD THE MAN!--The independent candidate still maintains silence. Because he dare not speak. Every accusation against him has been amply proved, and they have been indorsed and reindorsed by his own eloquent silence, till at this day he stands forever convicted. Look upon your candidate, Independents! Look upon the Infamous Perjurer! the Montana Thief! the Body-Snatcher! Contemplate your incarnate Delirium Tremens! your Filthy Corruptionist! your Loathsome Embracer! Gaze upon him--ponder him well--and then say if you can give your honest votes to a creature who has earned this dismal array of titles by his hideous crimes, and dares not open his mouth in denial of any one of them!	注意这个角色——独立党的候选人还在保持缄默。因为他根本不敢说话。一切对他的指控通通充分证实了，他自己那种等于招供的缄默态度已经一再承认了这些罪状，现在他是永远也不能翻供了。独立党党员们，请看你们这位候选人！请看这位声名狼藉的伪证犯！这位蒙大拿的小偷！这位盗尸犯！仔细看看你们这位酒疯症的化身！你们这个肮脏的舞弊分子！这个可恶的讹诈专家！睁开眼睛盯住他——把他仔细打量一番——然后再打定主意：像这么一个败类，他犯了滔天罪行，获得了一大串晦气的头衔而不敢张嘴否认任何一个，你们是否可以把你们的规规矩矩的选票投给他！
There was no possible way of getting out of it, and so, in deep humiliation, I set about preparing to "answer" a mass of baseless charges and mean and wicked falsehoods. But I never finished the task, for the very next morning a paper came out with a new horror, a fresh malignity, and seriously charged me with burning a lunatic asylum with all its inmates, because it obstructed the view from my house. This threw me into a sort of panic. Then came the charge of poisoning my uncle to get his property, with an imperative demand that the grave should be opened. This drove me to the verge of distraction. On top of this I was accused of employing toothless and incompetent old relatives to prepare the food for the foundling' hospital when I warden. I was wavering--wavering. And at last, as a due and fitting climax to the shameless persecution that party rancor had inflicted upon me, nine little toddling children, of all shades of color and degrees of raggedness, were taught to rush onto the platform at a public meeting, and clasp me around the legs and call me PA!	要想摆脱这种攻击，简直没有办法，所以在深感羞辱之余，我准备要“答复”那一大堆无稽的指控和那些下流而恶毒的谣言。可是我始终没完成这个工作，因为就在第二天早上，又有一个报纸登出一个新的恐怖事件，再度的恶意中伤，严厉地控诉我烧毁了一个疯人院，连里面所有的病人也给烧死了，为的是它妨碍了我的住宅的视线。这可使我陷入了恐慌的境地。然后又来了一个控诉，说我曾经为了夺取我的叔父的财产而把他毒死了，并提出紧急的要求，要挖开坟墓验尸。这简直把我吓得几乎要发疯。这一切还不够，又给我加了一个罪名，说我在弃婴收养所当所长的时候，曾经雇用了一些掉光了牙齿的老迈无能的亲戚担任烹饪的工作。我开始动摇了——动摇了。最后，党派相争的仇恨加到我身上的无耻的迫害终于很自然地发展到了一个高潮：九个刚学走路的小孩子，包括各种肤色，带着各种穷形尽相，被教唆着在一个公开的集会上闯到讲台上来，抱住我的腿，叫我爸爸！
On the fifth day-- again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep-- the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded:	第五天，还是羊的事，把小王子的生活秘密向我揭开了。好像默默地思索了很长时间以后，得出了什么结果一样，他突然没头没脑地问我：
I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.	我不知道该怎么回答。那会儿我正忙着要从发动机上卸下一颗拧得太紧的螺丝。我发现机器故障似乎很严重，饮水也快完了，担心可能发生最坏的情况，心里很着急。
The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head:	小王子一旦提出了问题，从来不会放过。这个该死的螺丝使我很恼火，我于是就随便回答了他一句：
"The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for spite！"	“刺么，什么用都没有，这纯粹是花的恶劣表现。”
There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness:	可是他沉默了一会儿之后，怀着不满的心情冲我说：
"I don't believe you！ Flowers are weak creatures. They reassure themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons…"　	“我不信！花是弱小的、淳朴的，它们总是设法保护自己，以为有了刺就可以显出自己的厉害……”
I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: "If this bolt still won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer." Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts.　	我默不作声。我当时想的，如果这个螺丝再和我作对，我就一锤子敲掉它。 小王子又来打搅我的思绪了：
"Oh, no！" I cried. "No, no no！ I don't believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head. Don't you see-- I am very busy with matters of consequence！"	“算了吧，算了吧！我什么也不认为！我是随便回答你的。我可有正经事要做。”
He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly…　	他瞅着我手拿锤子，手指沾满了油污，伏在一个在他看来丑不可言的机件上……
That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly:	这话使我有点难堪。可是他又尖刻无情地说道：
"You mix everything up together… You confuse everything…"　　	“你什么都分不清……你把什么都混在一起……”
He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.	他着实非常恼火。摇动着脑袋，金黄色的头发随风颤动着。
"I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence！' And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man-- he is a mushroom！"	“我到过一个星球，上面住着一个红脸先生。他从来没闻过一朵花。他从来没有看过一颗星星。他什么人也没有喜欢过。除了算账以外，他什么也没有做过。他整天同你一样老是说：‘我有正经事，我是个严肃的人’。这使他傲气十足。 他简直不象是个人，他是个蘑菇。”
The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death？ On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:	夜幕已经降临。我放下手中的工具。我把锤子、螺钉、饥渴、死亡，全都抛在脑后。在一颗星球上，在一颗行星上，在我的行星上，在地球上有一个小王子需要安慰！我把他抱在怀里。我摇着他，对他说：
I did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.	我也不太知道该说些什么。我觉得自己太笨拙。我不知道怎样才能达到他的境界，怎样才能再进入他的境界……
To cultivate one’s taste in English prose, the most effective way is to read English books extensively. Yet one may be at a loss to choose the appropriate books, especially as a beginner. I would like to share some of my experience. 	在培养阅读英文的兴趣方面，最有效的途径就是广泛的阅读英文作品。但是尤其对于初学者而言，在面对应该选择什么样的读物时很容易不知所措。在此呢，我希望可以分享一些自己的经验来给大家一些指引。 
My first English novel was Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, recommended by many English teachers and professors as an ideal book for English learners. But my experience was somewhat disastrous. Stumbling along the lines, I had great difficulty in understanding the novel, let alone enjoying it. It’s not the vocabulary that troubled me, but rather the way Austen constructs sentences, and her way of thinking, which seemed too remote to me at that time. My fading enthusiasm was much recovered after reading Hemingway’s novel Farewell to Arms. No long and complicated sentences. And I particularly liked his concise and straightforward style. So my first suggestion is, as a beginner, you’d better choose contemporary novels instead of classical ones. You can easily engage yourself in reading, get fun out of it, and gradually build up confidence. I do not mean to exclude classical novels for ever. Actually, the second reading of Pride and Prejudice greatly pleased me (probably the result of my improved English comprehension). It is only that classical novels are less accessible to beginners due to their language styles and social background. I’d like to recommend three contemporary novelists to you－Ursula Le Guin, Ernest Hemingway, and Doris Lessing. 	我所读的第一本英文小说是简·奥斯丁的《傲慢与偏见》，这本书被许多英语老师和教授推荐给英语学习者。但是我个人的经验却比较悲催。在阅读的过程中我连理解文章都非常困难，更谈不上欣赏文章了。倒不是里面有很多生词，更多的时候是简·奥斯丁的句法结构，还有她的思维模式，总让我觉得和我不在一个维度。而我的热情是在读了海明威的《永别了，武器》才重新回到我身边的。这本书里没有什么复杂的句子。我非常喜欢这种简约明快的文字风格。所以我对于初步涉足英文阅读的人的第一个建议就是，先读一些当代的文章而不是经典的文章。你可以更为轻松的获得阅读快感，并且找到阅读乐趣，最终慢慢的建立起自信。我并不是说就完全不用去读古典小说了。事实上，当我第二次拿起《傲慢与偏见》来读的时候，阅读体验非常不错（当然也不排除是由于我的英文水平提高了的缘故）。主要的原因是因为古典文章对于新手来说由于它的年代和语言方式更为难以理解。我在此推荐3个当代的小说家给大家：厄休拉·勒奎恩，欧内斯特·海明威还有多丽丝·莱辛。 
However, reading novels is not the only way to improve your English. In fact, if you restrict yourself to novels you will miss a lot of treasures. English essays can at once inform you, entertain you, and refine your taste in English. The best example is Bertrand Russell’s work. Its language is plain, yet you cannot help feeling the elegance and the peculiar sense of humor. His simple language enables his philosophy within the reach of ordinary people. The same is true of George Orwell’s work. Here comes my second suggestion－essays are indispensable. 	但是呢，阅读英文小说并不是唯一一个提升英文水平的办法。事实上，如果你只读小说，就会错失一大块宝藏。英语散文同样可以在第一时间给你知识和娱乐，同时还提高你的英文阅读品味。最好的例证就是伯特兰·罗素的作品了。虽然说他的语言本身比较平实，但是你依然能够从他的语言当中体会到那份优雅和特别的幽默。他语言的简单明了使得他的哲学可以被大多数普通人所理解。具有相同特点的还有乔治·奥威尔。所以我的第二个建议就是——散文同样是必不可少的。 
My last advice is never follow others’ recommendations and opinions blindly, however famous or influential the person might be. Some days ago, I listened to the audiobook of Somerset Maugham’s autobiography The Summing Up. In a chapter he regards Edward Gibbon and Samuel Johnson’s style as pompous. Though I admire Maugham’s prose, I cannot agree with his view. Probably one can label Johnson’s work as pretentious, but definitely not Gibbon’s. In fact, his lucid style makes his works highly readable, and you can hardly believe they were written over 200 years ago. Therefore, we should be open to various ideas, but always think and determine for ourselves. As a saying goes, one man’s meat is another man’s poison. With that in mind, we are bound to find out our favorite writers through reading and develop our fine taste in English. 	我的最后一个建议就是永远都不要盲目地跟随那些所谓名人或者有社会影响力的人的建议和推荐。我记得以前，我听毛姆自传《总结》的音频书籍。在某一章，他认为爱德华·吉布森和萨缪尔·约翰逊的风格是非常浮华的。虽然我非常欣赏毛姆，但是我并不同意他的观点。可能人们可以把约翰逊的文章说成是浮华，但是吉布森的文章则绝对不能这么说。事实上，吉布森的文字非常容易理解，以至于你都难以相信那是200年以前的作品。因此，我认为我们应该保持开放的心态，但是保持对自我的忠实。就像一句老话所说的，一个人的佳肴可能是另一个人的毒药。有这句话在心中，我们就可以尽情的去寻找那些我们最喜欢的作者，并提高自己的英语阅读品味。
Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life… For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me:	啊！小王子，就这样，我逐渐懂得了你那忧郁的生活。过去相当长的时间里你唯一的乐趣就是观赏那夕阳西下的温柔晚景。这个新的细节，是我在第四天早晨知道的。你当时对我说道：
At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me:	开始，你显得很惊奇的样子，随后你笑自己的糊涂。你对我说：
Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France.	确实，大家都知道，在美国是正午时分，在法国，正夕阳西下，只要在一分钟内赶到法国就可看到日落。
If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like…	可惜法国是那么的遥远。而在你那样的小行星上，你只要把你的椅子挪动几步就行了。这样，你便可随时看到你想看的夕阳余辉……
"You know-- one loves the sunset, when one is so sad."	“你知道，当人们感到非常苦闷时，总是喜欢日落的。”

As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs.	每天我都了解到一些关于小王子的星球，他的出走和旅行等事情。这些都是偶然从各种反应中慢慢得到的。就这样，第三天我就了解到关于猴面包树的悲剧。
This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly-- as if seized by a grave doubt-- "It is true, isn't it, that sheep eat little bushes?"　	这一次又是因为羊的事情，突然小王子好象是非常担心地问我道：“羊吃小灌木，这是真的吗?”
I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:	我不明白羊吃小灌木这件事为什么如此重要。可小王子又说道：
I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.	我对小王子说，猴面包树可不是小灌木，而是像教堂那么大的大树；即便是带回一群大象，也啃不了一棵猴面包树。
"That is strictly correct," I said. "But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?"	“不错。可是为什么你想叫你的羊去吃小猴面包树呢?”
He answered me at once, "Oh, come, come!", as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.	他回答我道：“唉!这还用说!”似乎这是不言而喻的。可是我自己要费很大的心劲才能弄懂这个问题。
Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived-- as on all planets-- good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin-- timidly at first-- to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.	原来，在小王子的星球上就像其他所有星球上一样，有好草和坏草；因此，也就有益草的草籽和毒草的草籽，可是草籽是看不见的。它们沉睡在泥土里，直到其中的一粒忽然想要苏醒过来……于是它就伸展开身子，开始腼腆地朝着太阳长出一棵秀丽可爱的小嫩苗。如果是小萝卜或是玫瑰的嫩苗，就让它去自由地生长。如果是一棵坏苗，一旦被辨认出来，就应该马上把它拔掉。
Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces.	因为在小王子的星球上，有些非常可怕的种子……这就是猴面包树的种子。在那里的泥土里，这种种子多得成灾。而一棵猴面包树苗，假如你拔得太迟，就再也无法把它清除掉。它就会盘踞整个星球。它的树根能把星球钻透，如果星球很小，而猴面包树很多，它就把整个星球搞得支离破碎。
"It is a question of discipline," the little prince said to me later on. "When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work," the little prince added, "but very easy."	“这是个纪律问题。”小王子后来向我解释道。“当你早上梳洗完毕以后，必须仔细地给星球梳洗，必须规定自己按时去拔掉猴面包树苗。这种树苗小的时候与玫瑰苗差不多，一旦可以把它们区别开的时候，就要把它拔掉。这是一件非常乏味的工作，但很容易。”
And one day he said to me: "You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes," he added, "there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes…"	有一天，他劝我用心地画一副漂亮的图画，好叫我家乡的孩子们对这件事有一个深刻的印象。他还对我说：“如果将来有一天他们出外旅行，这对他们是很有用的。有时候，人们把自己的工作推到以后去做，并没有什么妨害，但要遇到拔猴面包树苗这种事，那就非造成大灾难不可。我遇到过一个星球，上面住着一个懒家伙，他放过了三棵小树苗……”
So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. "Children," I say plainly, "watch out for the baobabs!"	于是，根据小王子的说明，我把这个星球画了下来。我从来不大愿意以道学家的口吻来说话，可是猴面包树的危险，大家都不大了解，对迷失在小行星上的人来说，危险性非常之大，因此这一回，我贸然打破了我的这种不喜欢教训人的惯例。我说：“孩子们，要当心那些猴面包树呀!”
Perhaps you will ask me, "Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?"
	你们也许要问，为什么这本书中别的画都没有这副画那么壮观呢?
The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.	回答很简单：别的画我也曾经试图画得好些，却没成功。而当我画猴面包树时，有一种急切的心情在激励着我。
I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!	我还了解到另一件重要的事，就是他老家所在的那个星球比一座房子大不了多少。
But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets-- such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus-- to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, "Asteroid 325."	这倒并没有使我感到太奇怪。我知道除地球、木星、火星、金星这几个有名称的大行星以外，还有成百个别的星球，它们有的小得很，就是用望远镜也很难看见。当一个天文学者发现了其中一个星星，他就给它编上一个号码，例如把它称作“325小行星”。
I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.	我有重要的根据认为小王子所来自的那个星球是小行星B612。
This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909.	这颗小行星仅仅在1909年被一个土耳其天文学家用望远镜看见过一次。
On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said.	当时他曾经在一次国际天文学家代表大会上对他的发现作了重要的论证。但由于他所穿衣服的缘故，那时没有人相信他。
Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report.	幸好，土耳其的一个独裁者，为了小行星B612的声誉，迫使他的人民都要穿欧式服装，否则就处以死刑。1920年，这位天文学家穿了一身非常漂亮的服装，重新作了一次论证。这一次所有的人都同意他的报告。
If you were to say to the grown-ups: "I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof," they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: "I saw a house that cost $20,000." Then they would exclaim: "Oh, what a pretty house that is!"	如果你对大人们说：“我看到一幢用玫瑰色的砖盖成的漂亮的房子，它的窗户上有天竺葵，屋顶上还有鸽子……”他们怎么也想象不出这种房子有多么好。必须对他们说：“我看见了一幢价值两万美元的房子。”那么他们就惊叫道：“多么漂亮的房子啊!”
Just so, you might say to them: "The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists." And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: "The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612," then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions. They are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people.	要是你对他们说：“小王子存在的证据就是他非常漂亮，他笑着，想要一只 羊他想要一只小羊，这就证明他的存在。”他们一定会耸耸肩膀，把你当作孩子看待!但是，如果你对他们说：“小王子来自的星球就是小行星B612”，那么他们就十分信服，他们就不会提出一大堆问题来和你纠缠。他们就是这样的。小孩子们对大人们应该宽厚些，不要埋怨他们。
But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should have like to say: 	当然，对我们懂得生活的人来说，我们才不在乎那些编号呢!我真愿意像讲神话那样来开始这个故事，我真想这样说：
For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures…	我可不喜欢人们轻率地读我的书。我在讲述这些往事时心情是很难过的。我的朋友带着他的小羊已经离去六年了。我之所以在这里尽力把他描写出来，就是为了不要忘记他。忘记一个朋友，这太叫人悲伤了。并不是所有的人都有过一个朋友。并且如果我忘记他，我可能变成那些大人那样，只对数字感兴趣。
The most widely read female writer in Turkey,Shafak effortlessly blends East and West, past and present, to create a dramatic, compelling, and exuberant tale about how love works in the world. 	Shafak是土耳其最负盛名的女作家，她的作品广为人知。在她的笔下，东西方文化、过去与现在，轻松融合，一段引人入胜而又妙趣横生的故事就此诞生，向读者讲述了爱如何在这个世界发挥作用。 
Shafak unfolds two parallel narratives-one set in the thirteenth century, when Rumi encountered his spiritual mentor, the wandering dervish known as Shams of Tabriz, and one contemporary, as an unhappy American housewife, inspired by Rumi's message of love, finds the courage to transform her life. 	沙法克在这本小说里展开了两条平行的叙述线，一位是13世纪时，鲁米遇见的精神导师——大不里士的流浪托钵僧沙姆斯；另一位则是现代一个郁郁寡欢的美国家庭主妇。她受到鲁米爱的信息的启发，鼓起勇气改变自己的生活。
In the novel, a nomadic family of circus performers, refugees from Romania, travels through Europe and Africa by caravan. The mother's death-defying act causes constant anxiety for her two daughters, who voice their fears through a grisly communal fairy tale about a child being cooked alive in polenta--but their real life is no less of a dark fable, and one that seems just as unlikely to have a happy ending.	在这本小说中，一个由杂耍演员组成的游牧家庭从罗马尼亚逃难出来，开着大篷车在欧洲和非洲巡演。母亲与死亡抗争的行为时常让她的两个女儿忧虑。她们靠讲一个骇人听闻、社区居民广为相传的神话故事来排解恐惧——一个小孩在玉米糊中被生生煮了。不过这两个孩子的现实生活也无异于一个黑暗的寓言故事，她们似乎不可能拥有一个美满结局。
It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.	我费了好长时间才弄清楚他是从哪里来的。小王子向我提出了很多问题。可是对我提出的问题，他好像压根没有听见似的。他无意中吐露的一些话逐渐使我搞清了他的来历。
The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane； that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:	当他第一次瞅见我的飞机时(我就不画出我的飞机了，因为这种图画对我来说太复杂)，他问我道：
"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane."	“这不是‘玩艺儿’。它能飞。这是飞机。是我的飞机。”
And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly. He cried out, then:	我当时很骄傲地告诉他我能飞。于是他惊奇地说道：
And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.	此时小王子发出一阵清脆的笑声。这使我很不高兴。我要求别人严肃地对待我的不幸。
"So you, too, come from the sky！ Which is your planet？"	“那么，你也是从天上来的了！你是哪个星球上的？”
At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence； and I demanded, abruptly:	即刻，对于他是从哪里来的这个秘密我隐约发现到了一点线索；于是，我就突然问道：
But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane:	可是他不回答我的问题。他一面看着我的飞机，一面微微地点点头，接着说道：
"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away…"	“可不是么，乘坐这玩艺儿，你不可能是从很远的地方来的……”
And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.	说到这里，他就长时间地陷入沉思之中。然后，从口袋里掏出了我画的小羊，看着他的宝贝入了神。
You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the "other planets." I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.	你们可以想见这种关于“别的星球”的若明若暗的话语使我心里多么好奇。因此我竭力地想知道其中更多的奥秘。
"My little man, where do you come from？ What is this 'where I live,' of which you speak？ Where do you want to take your sheep？"	“你是从哪里来的，我的小家伙？你的家在什么地方？你要把我的小羊带到哪里去？”
"The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house."	“好在有你给我的那只箱子，夜晚可以给小羊当房子用。”
"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to."	“那当然。如果你听话的话，我再给你画一根绳子，白天可以栓住它。再加上一根扦杆。”
"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get lost."	“如果你不栓住它，它就到处跑，那么它会跑丢的。”
Couldn't put it down. Literally. I neglected other duties for 36 hours. Excellent continuation of the story. Again, fascinating view of drivers of species survival seen through a different cultural lens, somewhat alien to my Western background. I did not expect it to follow the usual paths of English and USA scifi and it did not disappoint. Loved it.	真正的"手不释卷，爱不释手"，我翘班了36个小时。比第一部还精彩，再次通过有别于我的西方背景的不同的文化透镜，以引人入胜的视角，展现族群生存的驱动力。我没有期待本作与英美科幻有雷同，本作也没有让我失望。大爱。
Unfortunately the translation jarred at times. Luckily infrequently. But not enough for me to deduct a star.	翻译不时有些毛糙。还好不算频繁，没到让我减掉一颗星的程度。
Bought on Day 1 and finished on Day 3. It was a fantastic Sci-fi reading experience from beginning right to end. You just couldn't stop feeling surprised and stunned all the time, by those choices and decisions, regardless they matter or not, made by the characters. The unthinkable scope of the plot and sceneries just repeatedly stroke your imagination and nerves like. Twists and turns in both large and small scale are blended in the whole logical storyline, so it turns out to be more like a mind-bending blockbuster movie.	第一天就买了，第三天读完。从头到尾都是奇妙的科幻阅读体验。你会一直被书中角色作出的无论正确与否的选择和决定而震惊到。难以置信范畴的剧情和场景，不断地敲击你的想象和神经。大大小小的曲折逆转剧情编排进逻辑缜密的故事线，就像是一部深奥的电影大片。
Absolutely a fantastic story. Immensely imaginative. Especially love the author's deep thoughts on combining sociology and science, and his vivid presentation of the doom's day scenes. Put it on a very short list of my best sci-fi readings so far. Highly recommended. Already pre-ordered the final installation of the trilogy.	绝对的巨作，宽广的想象。尤其喜爱作者将社会学和科学结合到一起的深思熟虑，以及他将末世场景的生动展现。我将其列入我的最佳科幻的的屈指可数的名单。强烈推荐，已经预购三部曲的最后一部。
Absolutely loved both books, the dark forest perhaps even more than 3 body - one of the best modern sf reads out there, I'd give it 6 stars if I could :)	完全喜爱这两本书，第二部《黑暗森林》或许比《三体》还更好，《三体》已经是现代科幻最佳之一。可以的话我想给6星。:)
Liu postulates that humanity will struggleto put forth a united front against the aliens, even faced with annihilation infour centuries. This makes perfect sense from a psychological point of view:how many of us put off tomorrow what could be done today, like my daughterwatching YouTube when she should be studying, or humanity using up fossil fuelsand resources without concern for the next generation? Then imagine that 16generations will go by before the Trisolarans will come to Earth andexterminate us like bugs. Why bother worrying at all? And certainly much ofhumanity does respond this way.	大刘假定人类很困难地组成统一战线对抗外星人，即使面临400年后的灭亡。这从心理学角度来看非常合情合理，我们中间有多少人把本可"今日毕"的事拖延至明日，比如我女儿在本该学习的时候看油土鳖，又比如人类根本不考虑后世子孙而把化石燃料和其他资源消耗殆尽。再想象一下还要18代，三体人才会来到地球把我们像虫子一样灭掉，何必操心呢。肯定一大部分人会这样反应。
"Song of Solomon" ends up on many to-read book lists because of the author's 1993 Nobel Prize for literature, and because the book itself won the prestigious National Book Critics Fiction award in 1977. 	《所罗门之歌》出现在很多阅读清单上，因为它的作者获得了1993年的诺贝尔文学奖，并且该书本身也获得了1977年的著名的美国国家书评奖。
Somewhat like the James Joyce classic “Ulysses”, this book combines historical elements, free association, and unanswerable questions in the life of its main character. Beginning with a suicide and a black child's birth into a Michigan hospital, Morrison explores the complicated role of black family life, its heritage and its possible future. 	有点像詹姆斯·乔伊斯的经典《尤利西斯》，这本书融合了历史元素、自由联想以及无法回答的问题，展现了主角的生活。莫里森以自杀和在密歇根大学医院出生的黑人小孩开始，探讨了复杂角色的黑人家庭生活、遗产以及可能的未来。
One of Hemingway's most celebrated novels, “For Whom the Bell Tolls” is an adventure story of almost mythic proportions. The protagonist, a teacher named Robert Jordan, finds love and battle in the Spanish Civil War. Pilar, one of the most influential and passionate characters (though not the love interest), displayed the 'Everyman' fierce peasant spirit and embodied the name of the author's fishing vessel. 	《丧钟为谁鸣》是海明威最著名的小说之一，讲述的是一个带有神话色彩的冒险故事。主人公是一个叫罗伯特·乔丹的老师，在西班牙内战中经历斗争找到了真爱。皮拉尔是其中最有影响力和充满激情的人物（虽然不是爱慕对象），他展示了“普通人”强烈的农民精神，呈现了作者的渔船的名字。
This book is made of a series of essays on the validity and necessity of the United States Constitution, though it is more commonly referred to as the Federalist Papers. The reasoning behind political phrases in common use today, such as “checks and balances” and “bill of rights”, are worked out in 85 numbered works 	这本书由一系列关于美国宪法的有效性和重要性的文章构成，尽管它通常被称为《联邦党人文集》。现在普遍使用的政治短语的背后，例如“相互制衡”和“人权法案”，来收录于这85篇作品里。
While the main character in Graham Greene's novel “The Power and the Glory” hasn't lived the pure life of Jesus, his experiences while on the run in Mexico provide an eery similarity to his Lord's sufferings. 	虽然格雷厄姆·格林的小说《权利与荣耀》中的主要角色，不像耶稣那般纯粹的生活，但是墨西哥逃亡的经历展示了他与上帝极其相似的苦难。 
The nameless priest shows quite human flaws, with a daughter from a past love affair and a current drinking problem, while the antagonistic lieutenant (an atheist) appears more as a reverse Javier from Les Miserables. Greene personally suffered his way through a two-month research tour in Mexico, according to John Updike's New York Times review in 1990. 	这位无名的牧师带着一个和过去情人所生、有酗酒问题的女儿，尽展人性的弱点，然而，他和《悲惨的世界》中的敌对中尉（无神论者）是全然相反的。根据John Updike1990年的纽约时报书评，格林亲自去墨西哥研究了两个月。
While many books have been written about Franklin Delano Roosevelt, focusing on his struggles with polio and foreign policy. FDR's relationships with women, from his strong and confident mother to his secretary (to his love-interest, Lucy) are covered just as well as the Japanese internment camps and the dynamics of the New Deal. Smith has shown up on the Pulitzer Prize nomination list, for a previous work on another former President (Grant). 	虽然有很多写总统富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福的书，但是关注点都是同小儿麻痹症作斗争和外交政策。罗斯福总统同女人之间的关系，从他坚强而又自信的妈妈到他的秘书（他的挚爱，露西）都被隐藏了，还有日本拘留营以及新政的动荡也是如此。史密斯曾在另一位前任总统（格兰特）那里工作出色而出现普利策奖的提名名单上。
Partly a mystery, partly a social commentary. Greene's book belongs on mystery, history, and social commentary reading lists. Ostensibly, it's about a love triangle between an American, an Englishman, and an Asian woman. Behind the human tragedy is the tragedy of the French Indochina war, which served as a precursor to the Vietnam War. 	有谜团，也有社会评论。格林的书属于推理小说、历史、社会评论的阅读列表。表面上，它是关于一个美国男人、一个英国男人以及一个亚裔女子的三角恋故事。在人类悲剧的背后是法越战争的悲剧，它是越南战争的前兆。
This illustrated adventure book has been making book lists almost since publication. Sendak's classic won the Caldecott Medal in 1964, as the year's Most Distinguished Picture Book for children. 	这部有插图的冒险小说几乎自从出版后就被列入书单中了。作为年度著名儿童图画书，桑达克的经典系列获得了1964年的凯迪克奖。 
Max is a very relatable child who wants to dominate his environment, especially his mother. In a fantasy land of fearsome beasts, he is allowed to tame and conquer the way he would never be allowed to do at home, eventually becoming their honored king after a battle of wills. 	马克思是一个非常可靠的孩子，他想要支配他的环境，尤其是他的妈妈。在一个有着可怕野兽的神奇岛屿上，这些他在家里永远不能做的事，他却可以控制和征服，在一场意志较量后，他最终成了受尊敬的国王。
So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.	我就这样孤独地生活着，没有一个能真正谈得来的人，一直到六年前在撒哈拉沙漠上发生了那次故障。我的发动机里有个东西损坏了。当时由于我既没有带机械师也没有带旅客，我就试图独自完成这个困难的维修工作。这对我来说是个生与死的问题。我随身带的水只够饮用一星期。
The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:	第一天晚上我就睡在这远离人间烟火的大沙漠上。我比大海中伏在小木排上的遇难者还要孤独得多。而在第二天拂晓，当一个奇怪的小声音叫醒我的时候，你们可以想见我当时是多么吃惊。它说道：
I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best potrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.	我像是受到惊雷轰击一般，一下子就站立起来。我使劲地揉了揉眼睛，仔细地看了看。我看见一个十分奇怪的小家伙严肃地朝我凝眸望着。这是后来我给他画出来的最好的一副画像。可是，我的画当然要比他本人的模样逊色得多。
That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.	这不是我的过错。六岁时，大人们使我对我的画家生涯失去了勇气，除了画过开着肚皮和闭着肚皮的蟒蛇，后来再没有学过画。
Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:	我惊奇地睁大着眼睛看着这突然出现的小家伙。你们不要忘记，我当时处在远离人烟千里之外的地方。而这个小家伙给我的印象是，他既不像迷了路的样子，也没有半点疲乏、饥渴、惧怕的神情。他丝毫不像是一个迷失在旷无人烟的大沙漠中的孩子。当我在惊讶之中终于又能说出话来的时候，对他说道：
And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: "If you please-- draw me a sheep…"	可是他却不慌不忙地好像有一件重要的事一般，对我重复地说道：“请……给我画一只羊……”
When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap （a little crossly, too） that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:	当一种神秘的东西把你镇住的时候，你是不敢不听从它的支配的，在这旷无人烟的沙漠上，面临死亡的危险的情况下，尽管这样的举动使我感到十分荒诞，我还是掏出了一张纸和一支钢笔。这时我却又记起，我只学过地理、历史、算术和语法，就有点不大高兴地对小家伙说我不会画画。他回答我说：
But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside.	因为我从来没有画过羊，我就给他重画我所仅仅会画的两副画中的那副闭着肚皮的巨蟒。
And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with, "No, no, no！ I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep."	“不，不！我不要蟒蛇，它肚子里还有一头象。”我听了他的话，简直目瞪口呆。他接着说：“巨蟒这东西太危险，大象又太占地方。我住的地方非常小，我需要一只羊。给我画一只羊吧。”
"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."	“我不要，这只羊已经病得很重了。给我重新画一只。”
My friend smiled gently and indulgently. "You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns."	我的这位朋友天真可爱地笑了，并且客气地拒绝道：“你看，你画的不是小羊，是头公羊，还有犄角呢。”
"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."	“这一只太老了。我想要一只能活得长的羊。”
By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing. And I threw out an explanation with it.	我不耐烦了。因为我急于要检修发动机，于是就草草画了这张画，并且匆匆地对他说道：
I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:	这时我十分惊奇地看到我的这位小评判员喜笑颜开：
"That is exactly the way I wanted it！ Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass？"	“这正是我想要的，……你说这只羊需要很多草吗？”
"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small sheep that I have given you."	“我给你画的是一只很小的小羊，地方小也够喂养它的。”
"Not so small that-- Look！ He has gone to sleep…"	“并不像你说的那么小——瞧！它睡着了……”
I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children-- although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:	请孩子们原谅我把这本书献给了一个大人。我有一个正当的理由：这个大人是我在世界上最好的朋友。我还有另一个理由：这个大人什么都懂；即使儿童读物也懂。我还有第三个理由：这个大人住在法国，他在那里忍冻挨饿。他很需要有人安慰。要是这些理由还不够充分，我就把这本书献给这个大人曾经做过的孩子。每人大人都是从做孩子开始的。（然而，记得这事的又有几个呢？）因此，我把我的献词改为：
Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.	当我还只有六岁的时候，在一本描写原始森林的名叫《真实的故事》的书中，看到了一副精彩的插画，画的是一条蟒蛇正在吞食一只大野兽。页头上就是那副画的摹本。
In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."	这本书中写道：“这些蟒蛇把它们的猎获物不加咀嚼地囫囵吞下，尔后就不能再动弹了；它们就在长长的六个月的睡眠中消化这些食物。”
I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.	我把我的这副杰作拿给大人看，我问他们我的画是不是叫他们害怕。
My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:	我画的不是帽子，是一条巨蟒在消化着一头大象。于是我又把巨蟒肚子里的情况画了出来，以便让大人们能够看懂。这些大人总是需要解释。我的第二号作品是这样的：
The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.	大人们劝我把这些画着开着肚皮的，或闭上肚皮的蟒蛇的图画放在一边，还是把兴趣放在地理、历史、算术、语法上。就这样，在六岁的那年，我就放弃了当画家这一美好的职业。我的第一号、第二号作品的不成功，使我泄了气。这些大人们，靠他们自己什么也弄不懂，还得老是不断地给他们作解释。这真叫孩子们腻味。
So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.	后来，我只好选择了另外一个职业，我学会了开飞机，世界各地差不多都飞到过。的确，地理学帮了我很大的忙。我一眼就能分辨出中国和亚里桑那。要是夜里迷失了航向，这是很有用的。
In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.	这样，在我的生活中，我跟许多严肃的人有过很多的接触。我在大人们中间生活过很长时间。我仔细地观察过他们，但这并没有使我对他们的看法有多大的改变。
Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:	当我遇到一个头脑看来稍微清楚的大人时，我就拿出一直保存着的我那第一号作品来测试测试他。我想知道他是否真的有理解能力。可是，得到的回答总是：
"That is a hat."　　Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.	“这是顶帽子。”我就不和他谈巨蟒呀，原始森林呀，或者星星之类的事。我只得迁就他们的水平，和他们谈些桥牌呀，高尔夫球呀，政治呀，领带呀这些。于是大人们就十分高兴能认识我这样一个通情达理的人。
His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller.	他的相貌和外表极为引人注目，即便是最不经意的人看见了也难忘。他有六英尺多高，身体异常瘦削，因此显得格外颀长。
His eyes were sharp and piercing; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination.	他目光锐利；细长的鹰钩鼻子使他的相貌显得格外机警、果断；下颚方正而突出，说明他是个非常有毅力的人。
My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation.	一遇无事可做的时候，我就会心绪不宁起来。给我难题，给我工作，给我最深奥的密码，给我最复杂的分析工作，这样我才觉得最舒适，才不需要人为的刺激。我非常憎恶平淡的生活，我追求精神上的兴奋。
It was one of his peculiarities that in his more intense moments he would permit himself no food, and I have known him to presume upon his iron strength until he has fainted from pure inanition.	他在比较紧张的时候不让自己吃东西，这是他的一个古怪特性。我见过他滥用自己的体力，直到由于营养不足而晕倒。
That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn's Lieder, and other favourites.	我深知他能拉出一些曲子，而且还是一些很难拉的曲子。因为在我的请求之下，他曾经为我拉过几支门德尔松的短歌和一些他所喜爱的曲子。
When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air.	可是当他独自一人的时候，他就难得会拉出什么象样的乐曲或是大家所熟悉的调子了。
Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful.	晚上，他靠在扶手椅上，闭上眼睛，信手弹弄着平放在膝上的提琴。有时琴声高亢而忧郁，有时又古怪而欢畅。
Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I could determine.	显然，这些琴声反映了当时支配着他的某种思潮，不过这些曲调是否助长了他的这种思潮，或者仅仅是一时兴之所至，我就无法断言了。
MORE than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. -- She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. -- How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! -- Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions -- about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.	伊丽莎白在花园里散步的时候，曾经好多次出乎意料地碰见达西先生。别人不来的地方他偏偏会来，这真是不幸，她觉得好象是命运在故意跟她闹别扭。她第一次就对他说，她喜欢独自一人到这地方来溜达，当时的用意就是不让以后再有这种事情发生。如果会有第二次，那才叫怪呢。然而毕竟有了第二次，甚至还会有第三次，看上去他好象是故意跟她过不去，否则就是有心要来赔罪；因为这几次他既不是跟她敷衍几句就哑口无言，也不是稍隔一会儿就走开，而是当真掉过头来跟她一块儿走走。他从来不多说话，她也懒得多讲，懒得多听；可是第三次见面的时候，他问她住在汉斯福快活不快活，问她为什么喜欢孤单单一个人散步，又问起她是不是觉得柯林斯夫妇很幸福。谈起罗新斯，她说她对于那家人家不大了解，他倒好象希望她以后每逢有机会再到肯特来，也会去那儿小住一阵，从他的出言吐语里面听得出他有这层意思。难道他在替费茨威廉上校转念头吗？她想，如果他当真话里有音，那他一定暗示那个人对她有些动心。她觉得有些痛苦，她在已经走到牧师住宅对过的围墙门口，因此又觉得很高兴。
"I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?"	费茨威廉回答道：“我每年都是这样，临走以前总得要到花园里各处去兜一圈，最后上牧师家来拜望。你还要往前走吗？”
And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.	于是她果真转过身来，两人一同朝着牧师住宅走去。
"Yes -- if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases."	“是的，只要达西不再拖延。不过我得听他调遣。他办起事来只是凭他自己高兴。”
"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy."	“即使不能顺着他自己的意思去摆布，至少也要顺着他自己意思去选择一下。我从来没有看见过哪一个人，象达西先生这样喜欢当权作主，为所欲为。”
"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. "But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence."	“他太任性了，”费茨威廉上校回答道。“可是我们全都如此。只不过他比一般人有条件，可以那么做，因为他有钱，一般人穷。我是说的真心话。你知道，一个小儿子可就不得不克制自己，仰仗别人。”
"In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"	“在我看来，一个伯爵的小儿子，对这两件事简直就一点儿不懂。再说，我倒要问你一句正经话，你又懂得什么叫做克制自己和仰仗别人呢？我有没有哪一次因为没有钱，想去什么地方去不成，爱买一样东西买不成？”
"and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like."	“或许我在这方面也是不知艰苦。可是遇到重大问题，我可能就会因为没有钱而吃苦了。小儿子往往有了意中人而不能结婚。”
"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do."	“除非是爱上了有钱的女人，我认为这种情形他们倒往往会碰到。”
"Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money."	“我们花钱花惯了，因此不得不依赖别人，象我这样身份的人，结起婚来能够不讲钱，那可数不出几个了。”
"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."	“这些话都是对我说的吗？”伊丽莎白想到这里，不禁脸红；可是她立刻恢复了常态，用一种很活泼的声调说道：“请问一个伯爵的小儿子，通常值多少身价？我想，除非哥哥身体太坏，你讨起价来总不能超过五万镑。”
He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said, "I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her."	他也用同样的口吻回答了她，这事便不再提。可是她又怕这样沉默下去，他会以为她是听了刚才那番话心里难受，因此隔了一会儿，她便说道：“我想，你表兄把你带来待在他身边，主要就是为了要有个人听他摆布。我不懂他为什么还不结婚，结了婚不就是可以有个人一辈子听他摆布了吗？不过，目前他有个妹妹也许就行了；既然现在由他一个人照管她，那他就可以爱怎么对待她就怎么对待她了。”
"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."	“不，”费茨威廉上校说，“这份好处还得让我分享。我也是达西小姐的保护人。”
"Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way."	“你真的是吗？请问，你这位保护人当得怎么样？你们这位小姐相当难待候吧？象她那样年纪的小姐，有时候真不大容易对付；假若她的脾气也和达西一模一样，她自然也会样样事都凭她自己高兴。”
As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly replied, "You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them."	她说这话的时候，只见他在情恳意切望着她。他马上就问她说，为什么她会想到达西小姐可能使他们感到棘手。她看他问这句话的神态，就愈发断定自己果真猜得很接近事实。她立刻回答道：“你不必慌张。我从来没有听到过她有什么坏处；而且我敢说，她是世界上最听话的一位姑娘。我的女朋友们中有几个人，譬如赫斯脱太太和彬格莱小姐，都喜欢得她了不得。我好象听你说过，你也认识她们的。”
"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man -- he is a great friend of Darcy's."	“我和她们不大熟。她们的兄弟是个富有风趣的绅士派人物，是达西的好朋友。”
"Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily -- "Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."	“噢，是呀，”伊丽莎白冷冷地说：“达西先生待彬格莱先生特别好，也照顾得他十二万分周到。”
"Care of him! -- Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture."	“照顾他！是的，我的确相信，凡是他拿不出办法的事情，达西先生总会替他想出办法。我们到这儿来，路上他告诉了我一些事情，我听了以后，便相信彬格莱先生确实多亏他帮了些忙。可是我得请他原谅，我没有权利猜想他所说的那个人就是彬格莱。那完全是瞎猜罢了。”
"It is a circumstance which Darcy, of course, would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."	“这件事达西先生当然不愿意让大家知道，免得传到那位小姐家里去，惹得人家不痛快。”
"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."	“请你记住，我并没有足够的理由猜想他所说的那个人就是彬格莱。他只不过告诉我，他最近使一位朋友没有结成一门冒味的婚姻，免却了多少麻烦，他觉得这件事值得自慰，可是他并没有提到当事人的姓名和其中的细节；我所以会疑心到彬格莱身上，一则因为我相信象他那样的青年，的确会招来这样的麻烦，二则因为我知道，他们在一起度过了整整一个夏天。”
"Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"	“达西先生有没有说他为了什么理由要管人家闲事？”
"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling. "He only told me what I have now told you."	费茨威廉笑了笑说：“他并没有说明他用的是什么手段，他讲给我听的，我刚才全部都讲给你听了。”
Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.	伊丽莎白没有回答，继续往前走，她心里气透了。费茨威廉望了她一下，问她为什么这样思虑重重。
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she. "Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?"	她说：“我在回想你刚才说给我听的话，我觉得你那位表兄的做法不大好。凭什么要他作主？”
"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy." "But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case."	“我真不懂，达西先生有什么权利断定他朋友的恋爱合适不合适；凭着他一个人的意思，他怎么就能指挥他的朋友要怎样去获得幸福。”她说到这里，便平了一下气，然后继续说下去，“可是我们不明白其中的底细，那么，我们要指责他，也就难免不公平。也许这一对男女中间根本就没有什么爱情。”
"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."	“这种推断倒不能说不合情理。”费茨威廉说。“我表兄本来是一团高兴，给你这样一说，他的功劳可要大大地打折扣啦。”
This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage. There, shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world two men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might haveinflicted.	他这句话本是说着打趣的，可是她倒觉得，这句话正好是达西先生的一幅逼真的写照，她因此不便回答，便突然改变了话题，尽谈些无关紧要的事，边谈边走不觉来到了牧师住宅的门前。客人一走，她就回到自己房里闭门独坐，把刚才所听来的一番话仔细思量。他刚刚所提到的那一对男女，一定跟她有关。世界上决不可能有第二人会这样无条件服从达西先生。提到用尽手段拆散彬格莱先生和吉英的好事，一定少不了有他的份，她对于这一点从来不曾怀疑过；她一向认为完全是彬格莱小姐的主意和摆布。如果彬格莱先生本来并没有给虚荣心冲昏头脑，那么，吉英目前所受的种种痛苦，以及将来还要受下去的痛苦，都得归罪于他，归罪于他的傲慢和任性。世界上一颗最亲切、最慷慨的心，就这样让他一手把幸福的希望摧毁得一干二净；而且谁也不敢说，他造下的这个冤孽何年何月才能了结。
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.	“这位小姐有些条件太不够格，”这是费茨威廉上校说的；这些太不够格的条件也许就是指她有个姨爹在乡下当律师，还有个舅舅在伦敦做生意。
"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection. All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.	她想到这里，不禁大声嚷了起来：“至于吉英本身，根本就不可能有什么缺陷，她真是太可爱太善良了──她见解高，修养好，风度又动人，我父亲也没有什么可指摘的，他虽然有些怪癖，可是他的能力是达西先生所不能藐视的，说到他的品德，达西先生也许永远赶不上，”当然，当她想到她母亲的时候，她的信心不免稍有动摇；可是她不相信那方面的弱点对达西先生会有什么大不了的影响。最伤害他自尊心莫过于让他的朋友跟门户低微的人家结亲，至于跟没有见识的人家结亲，他倒不会过分计较。她最后完全弄明白了；达西一方面是被这种最恶劣的傲慢心理支配着，另方面是为了想要把彬格莱先生配给他自己的妹妹。
Not surprisingly, 2015 had a bumper crop of excellent books for entrepreneurs. That's a very good thing, because to be useful "start your own business" books must be grounded in the economic reality.	怪不得，2015年有一大堆企业家爱看的优秀书籍。这是件很好的事，因为作为“开创你自己事业”的有用书籍必定基于经济现实。
Here are ten brand-new books that you should read by the end of the year.	下面这10本全新的书籍，你应该在年底拜读一下。
The most innovative and intriguing entrepreneur of our time is ushering in a future that's as unexpected and disruptive as the erstwhile future that the PC and then the internet created.	我们这个时代最具创造力、最吸人眼球的创业家正在开创一个不可思议但又有破坏性的未来，正如之前由个人电脑以及因特网所开启的那个未来。
"Because of Musk, Americans could wake up in 10 years with the most modern highway in the world: a transit system run by thousands of solar power charging stations and traversed by electric cars……These advances are simultaneously difficult to fathom and seemingly inevitable if Musk can simply buy enough time to make them work."	“托马斯克的福，美国人在今后的十年里能享受到世界上最现代化的高速公路——它是由成千上万个太阳能供电站支撑起的交通系统，电动汽车在道路上飞驰……这些进步虽令人费解，但如果马斯克能赢得足够的时间来使其运作，那么它们看似将成为必然。”
"Social Security is, far away, Americans' most important retirement asset. And that's not only true for people of modest means. Middle-income and upper-income households actually have the most to gain, in total amounts, from getting Social Security right. Toting up lifetime benefits, even low-earning couples may be Social Security millionaires……Social Security is a very meaningful income source."	“社会保障从很早以前便是美国人最重要的退休资产。这不仅是对收入微薄的人而言。实际上，中层和上层收入家庭如果合理安排他们的社保，能在总数上获得最大回报。若是计算终生的福利总额，即便是收入颇低的夫妻也能通过社保成为百万富翁……社保是非常有意义的一项收入来源。”
A major corporation with a dominating market presence trashes its future due to the hubris and short-sightedness of its executive team.	一家主导市场的大公司由于领导层过于自信、缺乏远见而自毁前途。
Traditional economics assume that people are rational and will act in their own best interests, when in fact people are irrational and frequently make very silly and stupid decisions, both individually and en masse.
	传统的经济学假定人们是理性的，且均按自身利益最大化行动。而实际上，人们是非理性的。他们，要么集体，要么个人，经常做出极其愚蠢的决定。
"The problem is the model being used by economists (…) which I like to call an Econ for short. Compared to this fictional world of Econs, humans do a lot of misbehaving, and that means that economic models make a lot of bad predictions. Virtually no economists saw the financial crisis of 2007-08 coming, and worse, many thought that both the crash and its aftermath were things that simply could not happen."	“问题在于经济学家们使用的模型，（……），我喜欢将其简称为‘Econ’。与众多Econ模型构成的虚拟世界相比，人类的许多行为都不端正。而这意味着这些经济模型会带来诸多预测失误。几乎没有经济学家预见到了2007-2008年的金融危机，而且更糟的是，许多经济学家认为这场灾难及其后果本是可以不必发生的。”
A real-life account of an American financier who set out to expose corruption, murder, and a criminal conspiracy in Putin's Russia.	这本书是一位美国金融家在他开始披露普京领导的俄罗斯有怎样的腐败、谋杀和犯罪密谋后的真实叙述。
"10:45. I really began to panic. 10:51. How could I have been so stupid? Why would an average guy from the South Side of Chicago think he could get away with taking down one Russian oligarch after another? 10:58. Stupid, stupid, stupid! ARROGANT AND STUPID, BILL! ARROGANT AND JUST PLAIN STUPID! 11:02. I'm going to a Russian prison. I'm going to a Russian prison. I'm going to a Russian prison...."	“10点45分，真的，我开始慌张了。10点51分，我怎么会这么笨？作为一个来自芝加哥南面，没有背景的普通男孩，我为什么会认为自己在把俄罗斯寡头政治执政者一个个拉下马后还能平安度日？10点58分，笨蛋！笨蛋！笨蛋！比尔，你这个夜郎自大的家伙！傲慢又平庸的笨家伙！11点02分，我要被抓去俄罗斯坐牢了。我要被抓去俄罗斯坐牢了。我要被抓去俄罗斯坐牢了……”
Short story collections, personal essays, memoirs and historical fiction often move at a pace that allows for quiet contemplation.	短篇故事集、个人散文、回忆录和历史小说的行文总是能让读者安静沉思。
Pearlman writes quiet stories about the blips of tumult . She's been writing short stories -- and only short stories -- for decades, chronicling the lives of earnest blue collar workers and whimsical academics. Most of the stories are set in her native Massachusetts; all of them reveal something tender and universal about everyday life.	皮尔曼安安静静的笔调下有些许动荡和喧嚣。她一直就在写短篇小说，而且数十年来只写短篇小说，记录着热忱勤勉的蓝领工人还有异想天开的学者们的生活。大部分的故事背景都设置在她的故土马萨诸塞州，每一则故事都展现了日常生活细小而普遍的一面。 
Lily Tuck's latest novel isn't exactly a memoir, but it sits somewhere between novel and autobiography, blurring the lines between related memory and imagined possible scenarios. Like Tuck, heroine Liliane's parents divorced when she was young, wreaking personal havoc that mirrored the tragedies unfolding in Europe at the same time.	莉莉·塔克的最新小说确切说来不是回忆录，介于小说和自传间，模糊了记忆和想象场景的界限。和莉莉·塔克小时候一样，女主人翁莉莲年少父母离异，深受重创， 也映照出同期欧洲的悲剧。
Hunt tells his story about a woman disguised as a male solider through letters. The story is loosely based on a bundle of letters Hunt stumbled upon written by a real undercover female soldier and is a smart work of historical fiction that encourages contemplation.	亨特通过书信形式讲述了一个女子伪装成男军人的故事。亨特偶然间撞见一捆信件，是一个真实的卧底女军人所写的，亨特的历史小说稍稍以此为参照，引人深思，是部智慧的作品。
Protagonist Edith has built a happy family of her own among her tenants -- until she gets slammed with potential eviction as her mind begins to worsen. The unsteady state of their home and their landlady forges an even closer bond between the housemates in this lyrical meditation on what really makes up a family.	主人公伊蒂丝与其房客们建立了一个幸福的家庭，然而，随着记性变差，她或将被驱逐。家庭不稳定，女房东与房客们的关系更紧密了。这部抒情的沉思录引人思考究竟何为组成家庭的要素。
This book is a heartwarming time capsule, and fluid look at the way our interior lives have evolved, and how they've remained the same.	这本书是温暖人心的时空胶囊，以温婉的视角看我们的内心演变以及又如何初心不变。
the famously no-nonsense journalist and broadcaster Jeremy Paxman assesses what it means to be English today – specifically English, that is, not Welsh, Scottish, or Irish. In this wide-ranging work, Paxman charts the rise of a peculiar stereotype of Englishness that arose abroad in response to British colonialism, and its subsequent obsolescence following the disintegration of Empire. Emphasising the pluralistic interconnections between England's regions, cultures, and classes, The English gives historical grounding to some of the country' scurious social quirks and places them in the context of its people’s fluctuating identities.	以坦爽著称的记者、主持人Jeremy Paxman开门见山地评估当代英格兰人对自我的认识，并且分析其与威尔士人、苏格兰人、爱尔兰等人的差别。此作品内容广泛，Paxman在书中写道，大英帝国因在世界各地开拓殖民地，引起了当地人对英国人诸多的奇特偏见。如今，虽然大英帝国早已瓦解，但许多国家仍然保持着陈旧的偏见。通过描述英格兰各个地区、文化和社会阶级之间多样化的关系，Paxman描绘了英国社会的一些奇特怪癖的历史背景，并将它们和现代人变化多端的自我认知作比较。
ELIZABETH was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.	第二天早晨，柯林斯太太和玛丽亚到村里有事去了，伊丽莎白独自坐在家里写信给吉英，这时候，她突然吓了一跳，因为门铃响了起来，准是有客人来了。她并没有听到马车声，心想，可能是咖苔琳夫人来了，于是她就疑虑不安地把那封写好一半的信放在一旁，免得她问些卤莽的话。就在这当儿，门开了，她大吃一惊，万万想不到走进来的是达西先生，而且只有达西一个人。
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.	达西看见她单独一人，也显得很吃惊，连忙道歉说，他原以为太太小姐们全没有出去，所以才冒昧闯进来。
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergency recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed, "How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London."	他们俩坐了下来，她向他问了几句关于罗新斯的情形以后，双方便好象都无话可说，大有陷于僵局的危险。因此，非得想点儿什么说说不可；正当这紧张关头，她想起了上次在哈福德郡跟他见面的情况，顿时便起了一阵好奇心，想要听听他对那次匆匆的离别究竟有些什么意见，于是她便说道：“去年十一月你们离开尼日斐花园多么突然呀，达西先生！彬格莱先生看见你们大家一下子都跟着他走，一定相当惊奇吧；我好象记得他比你们只早走一天。我想，当你离开伦敦的时候，他和他的姐妹们一定身体都很好吧？”
She found that she was to receive no other answer -- and, after a short pause, added, "I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?"	她发觉对方没有别的话再回答她了，隔了一会儿便又说道：“我想，彬格莱先生大概不打算再回到尼日斐花园来了吧？”
"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing."	“我从来没有听到他这么说过；不过，可能他不打算在那儿久住。他有很多朋友，象他这样年龄的人，交际应酬当然一天比一天多。”
"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But perhaps Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle."	“如果他不打算在尼日斐花园久住，那么，为了街坊四邻着想，他最好干脆退租，让我们可以得到一个固定的邻居，不过彬格莱先生租那幢房子，说不定只是为了他自己方便，并没有顾念到邻舍，我看他那幢房子无论是保留也好，退租也好，他的原则都是一样。”
Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.	伊丽莎白没有回答。她唯恐再谈到他那位朋友身上去；既然没有别的话可说，她便决定让他动动脑筋，另外找个话题来谈。
He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford."	他领会了她的用意，隔了一忽儿便说道：“柯林斯先生这所房子倒好象很舒适呢。我相信他初到汉斯福的时候，咖苔琳夫人一定在这上面费了好大一番心思吧。”
"Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."	“柯林斯先生娶到了这样一位太太真是福气。”
"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding -- though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."	“是呀，的确是福气；他的朋友们应当为他高兴，难得有这样一个头脑清楚的女人肯嫁给他，嫁了他又能使他幸福，我这个女朋友是个绝顶聪明的人，不过她跟柯林斯先生结婚，我可不认为是上策。她倒好象极其幸福，而且，用普通人的眼光来看，她这门婚姻当然攀得很好。”
"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends."	“她离开娘家和朋友都这么近，这一定会使她很满意的。”
"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance."	“只要道路方便，五十英里能算远吗？只消大半天就到得了我认为很近。”
"I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match," cried Elizabeth. "I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her family."	“我从来没有认为道路的远近，也成了这门婚姻的有利条件之一，”伊丽莎白嚷道：“我决不会说柯林斯太太住得离家很近。”
As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered, "I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys -- and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance."	他说这话的时候，不禁一笑，伊丽莎白觉得自己明白他这一笑的深意：他一定以为她想起了吉英和尼日斐花园吧，于是她红了脸回答道：“我并不是说，一个女人家就不许嫁得离娘家太近。远近是相对的，还得看各种不同的情况来决定。只要你出得起盘缠，远一些又何妨。这儿的情形却不是这样。柯林斯夫妇虽然收入还好，可也经不起经常旅行；即使把目前的距离缩短到一小半，我相信我的朋友也不会以为离娘家近的。”
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise -- and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk. The tête-a-tête surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away.	于是他们俩把这个村庄短短地谈论了几句，彼此都很冷静，措辞也颇简洁。一会儿工夫，夏绿蒂跟她妹妹散步回来了，谈话就此终止。夏绿蒂姐妹俩看到他们促膝谈心，都觉得诧异。达西先生把他方才误闯进来遇见班纳特小姐的原委说了一遍，然后稍许坐了几分钟就走了，跟谁也没有多谈。
"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone. "My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way."	他走了以后，夏绿蒂说；“这是什么意思？亲爱的伊丽莎，他一定爱上你啦，否则他决不会这样随随便便来看我们的。”
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice -- a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out. -- She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.	可是达西先生为什么常到牧师家来，这仍然叫人不容易明白。他不可能是为了要热闹，因为他老是在那儿坐上十分钟一句话也不说，说起话来也好象是迫不得已的样子，而不是真有什么话要说──好象是在礼貌上委曲求全，而不是出于内心的高兴。他很少有真正兴高采烈的时候。柯林斯太太简直弄他不懂。费茨威廉有时候笑他呆头呆脑，可见他平常并不是这样，柯林斯太太当然弄不清其中的底蕴。她但愿他这种变化是恋爱所造成的，而且恋爱的对象就是她朋友伊丽莎，于是她一本正经地动起脑筋来，要把这件事弄个明白。每当她们去罗新斯的时候，每当他来到汉斯福的时候，她总是注意着他，可是毫无效果。他的确常常望着她的朋友，可是他那种目光究竟深意何在，还值得商榷。他痴呆呆地望着她，的确很诚恳，可是柯林斯太太还是不敢断定他的目光里面究竟含有多少爱慕的情意，而且有时候那种目光简直是完全心不在焉的样子。
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	她曾经有一两次向伊丽莎白提示过，说他可能倾心于她，可是伊丽莎白老是一笑置之；柯林斯太太觉得不应该尽在这个问题上唠叨不休，不要撩得人家动了心，到头来却只落得一个失望；照她的看法，只要伊丽莎白自己觉得已经把他抓在手里，那么，毫无问题，一切厌恶他的情绪自然都会消失的。
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.	她好心好意处处为伊丽莎白打算，有时候也打算把她嫁给费茨威廉，他真是个最有风趣的人，任何人也比不上他；他当然也爱慕她，他的社会地位又是再适当也没有了；不过，达西先生在教会里有很大的权力，而他那位表兄弟却根本没有，相形之下，表兄弟这些优点就无足轻重了。
BBC Culture contributor Jane Ciabattari surveyed 82 book critics from outside of the UK, in order to get an outsider's perspective on British literature.BBC	文化专栏投稿人Jane Ciabattari通过调查82位来自英国以外国家的书籍评论家，获得了外国人对英国文学的看法。
The Beeb said: "The British novel has influenced the form around the world for centuries, so we felt it was important to get a global perspective. The critics we polled live and work all over the world, from the United States and continental Europe to Australia, Africa, Asia, India and the Middle East ... Each who participated submitted a list of 10 British novels, with their pick for the greatest novel receiving 10 points. The points were added up to produce the final list."	BBC称：“几个世纪以来，英国小说一直影响着全球各地小说的形式，因此我们认为获得全球性的看法非常重要。我们调查的这些评论家在全球各地生活和工作，有的来自美国，有的来自欧洲大陆、澳大利亚、非洲、亚洲、印度和中东……每个参与者都给出一份列有10部英国小说的清单，被他们选作最经久不衰的小说可以获得10分。我们再对这些分数进行累加，得出最终的书单。”
The critics named 228 novels in all. These are the top 10:	这些评论家总共提到了228部小说，以下是获评前10的小说：
This pioneering work of science fiction and Gothic horror developed an indelible 'monster' of a theme that has endured for centuries: of the scientist as a "modern Prometheus".	这部先锋作品集科幻和哥特式恐怖于一身，营造了一个难以磨灭的“恶魔”主题，即科学家中的“现代普罗米修斯”，几世纪以来经久不衰。
Brontë's revolutionary 1847 Gothic romance about a young woman seeking a richer and more passionate life on her own still resonates with modern readers. Brontë's novel features the orphan Jane Eyre's search for an identity, her powerful attraction to her master, Mr Rochester, and an intimate description of her complex moral choices and sometimes raw emotional states.	勃朗特这部哥特式爱情传奇出版于1847年，内容革新，讲述了一个年轻女性追寻更为充实激情的生活，至今仍能引起现代读者的共鸣。 勃朗特小说的主人翁简·爱是个孤儿，追寻着自我的身份，主人罗切斯特先生深深吸引着她，其情至真令简`爱无法抗拒；小说真切描述了简·爱复杂的道德抉择及其有时显得有些原始的情感状态。
Great Expectations might be the quintessential British novel. To re-read Dickens' classic as an adult is to discover its wit and brio, its influence, and its truth. It has all the elements of classic Dickens – endearing, flawed characters; a plot that skewers the politics of the time; subplots that skewer morality and culture; a love story; and a wonderful storyline.	《远大前程》或许是最地道的英国小说。成年读者重温狄更斯经典，去发现其智慧与精彩、影响与真理。《远大前程》有狄更斯经典的所有元素，讨人欢喜却不甚完美的角色、主要故事情节能牵住时局、副线情节串起道德与文化，是部情节精彩的爱情故事作品。
If the most precious gift of the novel as a medium is the power it has to break into the prison of human consciousness, to expose the gossamer weave of thought and feeling and memory that makes up our innermost lives, then Woolf's fourth novel stands alone at the pinnacle.Virginia Woolf made modernism live and breathe.	如果说这部小说作为媒介最天才之处在于其破除人类意识的囹圄、显露人们细若蛛丝的思绪、显露构成我们内心生活的记忆，那么伍尔芙的第四部小说本身就是鼎峰之作。弗吉尼亚让现代主义焕发新生、重现生机。
Subtle, beautiful, staggeringly intelligent and flat-out original. A masterpiece of modernism, its stream-of-consciousness, richness of language and perceptions has continued to reveal itself.	细腻美妙、智慧惊人，是不折不扣的原创之作。现代派的大师之作，运用意识流写法，其语言丰富、观察敏锐，不言自明。 
A novel of great characters, it's an even greater novel of ideas and ideals. Middlemarch is the greatest social and psychological novel ever written in English.	这部小说人物角色卓越，更精妙之处在于其想法与理念。《米德尔马契》是迄今最伟大的英文社会心理学小说。
What it does better than any other recent book is relentlessly drive home the point that "racism is a visceral experience..."To be black in the ghetto of Coates's youth "was to be naked before the elements of the world, before all the guns, fists, knives, crack, rape, and disease."	相较于其他新书，它更加残酷地指出："种族主义是一种发自内心的体验……"作为一名贫民窟的黑人，科茨的青春"在全世界面前变得赤裸裸，在枪支、拳头、刀、爆炸、强奸和疾病面前手无寸铁，毫无反击之力"。
In the summer of 1942, German soldiers expelled almost 200 starving children from an orphanage in the Warsaw Ghetto and packed them into rail cars bound for Treblinka.	1942年夏，华沙犹太孤儿院里将近200位饥饿的儿童被德国士兵驱逐，装进了开往特雷布林卡集中营的火车上。
Drawing on his imagination and dozens of historical sources, Shepard brings the Warsaw orphanage to life in this remarkable novel about a poor Polish boy and his friendship with the caretaker of the orphans, the pediatrician Janusz Korczak.	作者谢巴德发挥想象，结合大量史料，在这部著名的小说中再现了华沙孤儿院的生活，讲述了一个贫穷的波兰男孩和孤儿院看守、儿科医生雅努什·科扎克之间的深厚友谊。
In Meacham's telling, Bush indeed lacked an ideological vision, was as overmatched in domestic policy as he was masterful on the global stage, benefited from his family's influence, and remains overshadowed "by the myth of his predecessor and the drama of his sons
' political lives."	在米查姆的讲述中，布什确实缺乏一种意识形态视野，他对国内政策的掌控能力远逊于对国际事务的处理能力，他得益于来自家庭的影响，却至今仍活在前任的神话以及儿子戏剧性政治生涯的阴影之中。
A detailed appraisal of how the Soviet Union handled undercover operations from the communist revolution in 1917 until the end of the cold war. The most gripping chapters focus on the chaos that was unleashed by Josef Stalin.	详尽评价了苏联自1917年革命到冷战结束期间在秘密战线的行动，最扣人心弦的篇章斯大林制造的混乱。
Two knowledgeable journalists offer a bird's-eye view of everyday life that teases out how the famine of the 1990s prompted unexpected change in the attitudes, governance and lives of ordinary North Koreans, giving the lie to the simplistic view that Koreans are a homogenous people under the thumb of a power-crazed dictator.	两位博闻强识的作者通观日常生活，找出上世纪九十年代的饥荒如何让普通朝鲜人的生活态度、政府治理和生活发生不期的变化，人们以为朝鲜人是一个嗜权独裁者股掌中的同质人，这一简单看法被证明是谎言。
Black men are still dying at alarming rates in the toughest urban pockets even though, overall, America's murder rate is down. A study of one neighbourhood in Los Angeles has the power to change how people think about policing in America.	尽管美国谋杀率整体下降，但最恶劣的城市环境中，黑人还是以惊人的速度死去。对洛杉矶一个社区的研究将改变人们对美国警察执法的看法。
How a multinational Muslim empire was destroyed by the first world war, by a historian of the 20th century who is director of the Middle East Centre at Oxford University.	一个横跨多国的穆斯林帝国如何在第一次世界大战中毁灭？剑桥大学中东中心主任娓娓道来。
A historian at Yale University has made a detailed study of where Jews were in most danger during the second world war. In France and Italy, three-quarters of the Jews survived. In eastern territories, which suffered "double occupation", first by the Soviets and then by the Nazis, at least 90% of them perished.	耶鲁大学历史学家详尽研究了二战中哪里的犹太人最危险。在法国和意大利，四分之三的犹太人存活了下来。在东部战场，被苏联和纳粹双重占领的地区，至少90%的犹太人死亡。
A masterly new chronicle, by Britain's most engaging historian of the ancient world, about Rome from its myth-shrouded origins to the early third century. She shows that the key to its dominance was granting citizenship to so many people.	一部了不起的新编年史，英国最出色的古代史学家从罗马的神秘起源讲到三世纪早期。她证明统治的关键是给予更多人公民权。
By focusing on a sector that until 1900 was the world's most important manufacturing industry, Sven Beckert offers a fine account of 900 years of globalisation.	直到1900年，棉花都是世界上最重要的制造产业，作者专注于其900年的全球化历史。

Carnegie's classic self-help book counts people as diverse as oracular investor Warren Buffet and murder-mastermind Charles Manson among its acolytes. The book, which comprises a recipe for getting ahead, has sold more than 15 million copies since it was first published. Transcribed with help from a stenographer (at the suggestion of a Simon & Schuster exec who heard Carnegie speak), this likeability manual spawned from a popular lecture course taught by Carnegie. Here's a nugget of Carnegie's counsel: "You can't win an argument. You can't because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it."	这是卡耐基经典的自我帮助类著作，股神沃伦•巴菲特和杀人魔王查尔斯•曼森都是本书的信徒。书中包含一系列取得成功的秘诀，自首次出版以来已卖出超过1,500万本。这本人际关系手册的出版得益于一名速记员的帮助(根据一位听过卡耐基演讲的西蒙与舒斯特出版公司高管的建议)，内容取自卡耐基颇受欢迎的演讲课程内容。卡耐基有一句名言：“你不可能赢得争论。因为如果你输了，你当然也就输了；如果你赢了，可你还是输了。”
Turn that frown upside-down: In the relentlessly upbeat world of post-World War II America, where everything seemed like it was on the rise and always would be, Peale optimistically codified simple procedures for "mastering the problems of everyday living." Don't be defeated, he counsels. The book "is written with the sole objective of helping the reader achieve a happy, satisfying, and worthwhile life."	不要眉头紧锁：二战后的美国一片繁荣，一切似乎都蒸蒸日上，并且会一直持续下去，皮尔乐观地编写出一套旨在“解决日常生活难题”的简单程序。他忠告读者：不要被击败。这本书“只有一个目的：帮助读者获得幸福美满、有价值的生活。”
In the 1950s, psychiatrist Eric Berne expanded on Freud's theories of psychoanalysis to develop his own system of diagnosis and therapy called Transactional Analysis. Rather than speculating about the unconscious mind to explain human behavior, Berne schematized social interactions—aka his "transactions."	上世纪50年代，精神病学专家埃里克•伯恩进一步阐述了佛洛依德的精神分析理论，并形成了自己的诊断与治疗体系：交互分析 (Transactional Analysis)。伯恩并非通过推测潜意识来解释人类行为，而是将社会互动系统化——也就是他的“交互”。
Managerial magician Stephen Covey became a much sought-after exec-whisperer . Offering sharp saws like Be Proactive (Habit No. 1), Think Win-Win (No. 4), and, well, Sharpen the Saw (No. 7), the book delivers succinct, memorable advice. Covey, a onetime teacher at Brigham Young University's School of Management and co-founder of its Department of Organizational Behavior, eventually set up a consulting business to market his insights. While Covey's axioms may come as no surprise to some, it's the book's digestible structure that wins him converts—including former President Bill Clinton, who once invited Covey to Camp David for personal guidance.	管理学大师史蒂芬•柯维成了极受欢迎的高管导师。书中为读者提供了简洁但令人记忆深刻的建议，如积极主动(习惯1)、双赢思维(习惯4)和不断更新(习惯7)。柯维曾任杨百翰大学(Brigham Young University)管理学院讲师，也是该校组织行为学系的联合创始人，他后来成立了自己的咨询公司，宣传自己的理论。柯维的理论虽然对有些人而言并不新鲜，但本书易于理解的结构却为他赢得了大批拥护者，美国前总统比尔•克林顿曾邀请柯维前往戴维营对他进行个人指导。
Conceived of as a collection of 101 inspiring stories more than two decades ago, the book begat a mega-franchise. Motivational speakers Canfield and Hansen took on the original project after their audience members solicited them to compile anecdotes from their talks. Snowballing into more than 250 titles and selling more than 110 million copies in the U.S. and Canada, the series has become a fixture of bookshelves across the world. Sold in 2008 to three new owners, the franchise has not lost steam. It has since launched a YouTube Channel and comfort food lines for both pets and humans.	20年前构想本书时，作者只是希望编撰一本由101篇鼓舞人心的故事组成的合集，未曾想“心灵鸡汤”最终演变为一个巨大的特许经营品牌。励志演讲家坎菲尔德与汉森当初着手这个项目的原因是，有听众请求他们将演讲中提到的故事编辑成册。如今，该图书系列已经超过250种，在美国与加拿大的总销量超过 1.1亿本，在世界其他国家也大受欢迎。2008年，该图书的特许经营权被出售，但其热度不减，先后推出一个YouTube频道，以及针对宠物和人类的安慰食品系列。
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.	他们当然都接受了邀请，准时到达了咖苔琳夫人的会客室。夫人客客气气地接待了他们，不过事实很明显，他们并不象请不到别的客人那样受欢迎；而且夫人的心几乎都在两位姨侄身上，只顾跟他们说话，特别是跟达西说话比跟房间里任何人都说得多。
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself as well as of Mr. Darcy. His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out, "What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is."	倒是费茨廉上校见到他们好象很高兴；因为罗新斯的生活实在单调无味，他很想要有点调剂，而且柯林斯太太的这位漂亮朋友更使他十分喜欢。他就坐到她身边去，那么有声有色地谈到肯特郡，谈到哈福德郡，谈到旅行和家居，谈到新书和音乐，直谈得伊丽莎白感觉到在这个房间里从来没有受到过这样的款待；他们俩谈得那么兴致淋漓，连咖苔琳夫人和达西先生也注意起来了。达西的一对眼睛立刻好奇地一遍遍在他们俩身上打溜转；过了一会儿工夫，夫人也有了同感，而且显得更露骨，她毫不犹豫地叫道：“你们说的什么？你们在谈些什么？你跟班纳特小姐在谈些什么话？说给我听听看。”
"We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.	“我们谈谈音乐，姨母，”费茨廉上校迫不得已地回答了一下。
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"	“谈音乐！那么请你们说得响一些吧。我最喜爱音乐。要是你们谈音乐，就得有我的份儿。我想，目前在英国，没有几个人能象我一样真正欣赏音乐，也没有人比我趣味更高。我要是学了音乐，一定会成为一个名家。安妮要是身体好，也一定会成为一个名家的。我相信也演奏起来，一定动人。乔治安娜，现在学得怎么样啦，达西？”
Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	达西先生极其恳切地把自己妹妹的成就赞扬了一番。
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal."	“听到她弹得这样好，我真高兴，”咖苔琳夫人说：“请你替我告诉她，要是她不多多练习，那她也好不到哪里去。”
"I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly."	“姨母，你放心吧，”达西说，“她用不着你这样的劝告。她经常在练习。”
"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano forte in Mrs. Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house."	“那就更好。练习总不怕太多，我下次有空写信给她，一定要嘱咐她无论如何不得偷懒。我常常告诉年轻的小姐们说，要想在音乐上出人头地，就非要经常练习不可。我已经告诉班纳特小姐好几次，除非她再多练习练习，她永远不会好到哪里去；我常常对她说，柯林斯太太那里虽然没有琴，我却很欢迎她每天到罗新斯来，在姜金生太太房间里那架钢琴上弹奏。你知道，在那间房间里，她不会妨碍什么人的。”
Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer.	达西先生看到姨母这种无礼的态度，觉得有些丢脸，因此没有去理她。
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said, "You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me."	喝过了咖啡，费茨廉上校提醒伊丽莎白说，她刚刚答应过弹琴给他，于是她马上坐到琴边去。他拖过一把椅子来坐在她身旁。咖苔琳夫人听了半支歌，便象刚才那样又跟这一位姨侄谈起话来，直谈得这位姨侄终于避开了她，从容不迫地走到钢琴跟前站住，以便把演奏者的美丽的面貌看个清楚明白。伊丽莎白看出了他的用意，便趁机住手，回过头来对他娇媚地一笑，说道：“达西先生，你这样走过来听，莫不是想吓唬我？尽管你妹妹的确演奏得很好，我也不怕。我性子倔强，决不肯让别人把我吓倒。人家越是想来吓倒我，我的胆子就越大。”
"I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own."	达西说：“我决不会说你讲错了，因为你不会真以为我存心吓你；好在我认识你很久了，知道你就喜欢说一些并不是你自己心里想说的话。”
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire -- and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."	伊丽莎白听到人家这样形容她，便高兴地笑了起来，于是对费茨廉说道：“你表兄竟在你面前把我说成一个多糟糕的人，教你对我的话一句也不要相信。我真晦气，我本来想在这里骗骗人，叫人相信我多少有些长处，偏偏碰上了一个看得穿我真正性格的人。──真的，达西先生，你把我在哈福德郡的一些倒霉的事儿都一股脑儿说了出来，你这是不厚道的──而且，请允许我冒昧说一句，你这也是不聪明的──因为你这样做，会引起我的报复心，我也会说出一些事来，叫你的亲戚们听了吓一跳。”
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. "I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."	费茨威廉连忙叫道：“我倒要请你说说看，他有什么不是。我很想知道他跟陌生人一起的时候，行为怎么样。”
"You shall hear then -- but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball -- and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances! I am sorry to pain you -- but so it was. He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."	“那么我就讲给你听吧；我先得请你不要骇怕。你得明白，我第一次在哈福德郡看见他，是在一个舞会上，你知道他在这个跳舞会上做些什么？他一共只跳了四次舞！我不愿意叫你听了难受，不过事实确是这样。虽说男客很少，他却只跳了四次，而且我知道得很清楚，当时在场的女客中间，没有舞伴而闲坐在一旁的可不止一个人呢 ──达西先生，你可不能否认有这件事哟。”
"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party."	“说来遗憾，当时舞场上除了我自己人以外，一个女客也不认识。”
"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room. Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders."	“不错；跳舞场里是不作兴请人家介绍女朋友的。──唔，费茨威廉上校，再叫我弹什么呢？我的手指在等着你吩咐。”
"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."	达西说：“也许我当时最好请人介绍一下，可是我又不配去向陌生人自我推荐。”
"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"	“我们要不要问问你的表兄，这究竟是什么缘故？”伊丽莎白仍然对着费茨威廉上校说话。“我们要不要问问他，一个有见识、有阅历、而又受过教育的人，为什么不配把自己介绍给陌生人？”
"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble."	费茨威廉说：“我可以回答你的问题，用不着请教他。那是因为他自己怕麻烦。”
"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done."	达西说：“我的确不象人家那样有本领，遇到向来不认识的人也能任情谈笑。我也不会象人家那样随声附和，假意关切。”
"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because I would not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution."	伊丽莎白说：“我谈起钢琴来，手指不象许多妇女那么有气派，也不象她们那么有力和灵活，也没有她们弹得那么有表情。我一直认为这是我自己的缺点，是我自己不肯用功练习的缘故。我可不信我的手指不及那些比我弹奏得高明的女人。”
Darcy smiled, and said, "You are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers."	达西笑了笑说：“你说得完全对。可见你的成绩要好得多。凡是有福份听过你演奏的人，都觉得你毫无欠缺的地方。我们两人可就不愿意在陌生人面前表演。”
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy, "Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."	说到这里，咖苔琳夫人大声地问他们谈些什么，打断了他们的话。伊丽莎白立刻重新弹起琴来。咖苔琳夫人走近前来，听了几分钟以后，就对达西说：“班纳特小姐如果再多练习练习，能够请一位伦敦名师指点指点，弹起来就不会有毛病了。虽说她的趣味比不上安妮，可是她很懂得指法。安妮要是身体好，能够学习的话，一定会成为一位令人满意的演奏者。”
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation.	伊丽莎白望着达西，要看看他听了夫人对他表妹的这番夸奖，是不是竭诚表示赞同，可是当场和事后都看不出他对她有一丝一毫爱的迹象、从他对待德·包尔小姐的整个态度看来，她不禁替彬格莱小姐感到安慰：要是彬格莱小姐跟达西是亲戚的话，达西一定也会跟她结婚。
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.	咖苔琳夫人继续对伊丽莎白的演奏发表意见，还给了她许多关于演奏和鉴赏方面的指示。伊丽莎白只得极有忍耐地虚心领教。她听从了两位男客的要求，一直坐在钢琴旁边，弹到夫人备好了马车送他们大家回家。
The real story behind Monopoly, and the woman who went unrecognized for her role in its creation. 	大富翁游戏背后的真实故事，以及在它的创作过程中的一位不为人知的女人。
A generous portrayal of a couple's affirming response to their transgender child. 	精彩地描写了一对伴侣如何坚定地支持他们变性的孩子。
Groff's complex and remarkable novel about marriage offers two critically different narratives, first from the husband’s point of view, then from the wife's. 	格罗夫复杂而又精彩的小说讲述婚姻的故事，提供两个截然相反的叙述，一个是从丈夫的角度，一个是从妻子的角度。
A corner of the living room of the author’s childhood home in New Jersey is viewed over a period of eons in this graphic novel, which introduces a third dimension to the flat page. 	这本图文书中，作者跨越了无数年的时间，回到了童年时代新泽西家中起居室的一角，书页上有三维效果。
The journey to get rich requires certain tools. Although many seem to ignore this, books can help you build your mind, zeal and knowledge to become successful and rich. Therefore I have taken the effort to look through some amazing books that can do a lot to get your financial journey oriented in the right direction.	通往财富的路上需要一些辅助工具。然而许多人忽略了这一点，下面介绍一些书籍，可以帮助你建立自信，充满热情，帮助你致富和成功。这些书籍可以引导你在致富路上找到百万正确的方向。
This classic which was first published in 1996 and written by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko offers in-depth knowledge from the findings of the authors of how America's millionaires became rich in seven key steps. One of the high points discussed was the simple and strategic method of spending less than you earn. By doing this, you could avoid impulse buying and diversify your investments.	这本书出版于1996年，作者是托马斯·斯坦利和威廉·丹科，讲述美国的百万富翁的七项成功原则。基中最重要的一点，也是很简单的一点就是花费要比收入少。这样做可以避免盲目消费和改变投资方向。
Robert T. Kiyosaki's book remains a stunner any day and anytime. It is a must read if you want to start crafting a path to wealth while you are young. In this book, Kiyosaki was able to bring the distinguishing factor or habits of his father, who was a highly educated man yet poor, and his other father who was a dropout but became a self-made multimillionaire. The focus follows what are termed the different “quadrants” of the different classes of people in society and how you can elevate yourself to the Investor quadrant which will make you super rich.	罗伯特T清崎每一天时时刻刻应该节俭。如果你想趁年轻的时候致富这本书应该是必读的。在这本书里罗伯特T清崎分别讲述了关于穷爸爸，即一个受过良好的教育的人的生活习惯，和富爸爸，没读过什么书却成为一个白手起家的千万富翁。这本书着重点在于研究社会不同阶层不同“象限”理查德·布兰森的人以及如何提升自我，成为拥有财富的投资者。
Everybody wants success. Some people aim for it; others just talk about it. We all know what it looks like when someone else has it. Often times it just seems like something too far out of reach.	每个人都渴望成功。有的人努力去争取，有的人只是说说而已。我们都知道一个真正成功了的人是什么样的，但很多时候那个样子看起来是那么遥不可及。
The truth to success is closer than you think. It's just on the other side you have to want it enough, and be willing enough to get it.	实际上成功并没有你想象的那么遥远。成功就在彼岸，只要你足够期望、足够想要实现它。
Fear is your biggest obstacle fear of failure, fear of the judgment of others; fear of actually succeeding. It will trip you up every time. It will cause you to make decisions that may seem "right" at the time, but they're preventing you from actually getting over that wall.	恐惧是你最大的障碍：害怕失败，害怕他人的评判，害怕真正的成功。这些障碍会经常绊倒你，会让你在看似正确的时候做出决定，但实际上他们却阻碍了你真正翻越那道墙。
Success has no excuses. You either get it or you don't. The minute you find a reason not to take another step towards success is the moment you stop being successful. In the symphony of success, excuses are just noise.	成功没有借口。要么真的实现，要么就是未能实现。当你找到一个理由决定停止走向成功时，便是你停止成为成功之人的那一刻。在成功的交响乐中，借口只是噪音。
Everyone faces changes; different ones at different times. We all handle the same challenges differently; we all have different results. It's how you handle each one and what you do with the results that count. An obstacle is something you either find a way around or allow to stop you. Remember, you've got to get passed obstacles in order to succeed.	每个人都会面临改变，只是不同的人会在不同的时间（面临改变）。我们都需要迎接同样的挑战，但结果却不尽相同。差别在于你是如何应对每一个挑战的，以及你如何应对每一个挑战的结果。你要么找到方法来解决它，要么停止不前，这是你通往成功的一大障碍。记住，你必须跨越障碍才能走向成功。
It takes effort, commitment and follow-through	成功需要付出，需要承诺，需要坚持到底地不停尝试
They call it aladder of success for a reason... because you need to climb it in order to get somewhere. It's not an escalator. You just don't stand there and let it do the work for you. You have to do the work yourself. Sometimes it will be easy; other times you'll be carrying a heavy load on your shoulders. The ladder remains the same. Success still waits on the other side. It's going to take determination and persistence on your part to get up and over that wall.	人们把通往成功的路称作阶梯，因为你需要不停地往上攀爬才能达到某个地方。但它不是自动扶梯，你不能只是站在上面并期待它直接将你运上去，你必须自己亲自往上爬。有时候会很容易，有时候你会肩负重担往上走。但梯子并没有变，成功仍然在另一头等着你。你需要做出决定，坚持不懈往上爬，并翻越那道墙。
SIR WILLIAM staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.	威廉爵士在汉斯福只待了一个星期，可是经过了这一次短短的拜访，他大可以为了：女儿嫁得极其称心如意，而且有了这样不可多得的丈夫和难能可贵的邻居。威谦爵士在这儿作客的时候，柯林斯先生总是每天上午同他乘着双轮马车，带他到郊野去漫游;他走了以后，家里又恢复了日常生活。伊丽莎白真要谢天谢地。因为这一次作客，跟她表兄柯林斯朝夕相见的次数并不多。原来他从吃早饭到吃午饭那一段时间里，不是在收拾花园，就是在自己那间面临着大路的书房里看书写字，凭窗远眺，而女客的起坐间又在后面那一间。伊丽莎白开头很奇怪：这里的餐厅比较大，地位光线也比较好，为什么夏绿蒂不愿意把餐厅兼作起居室?可是她立刻看出了她朋友所以要这样做，的确非常有理由，因为：假如女客也在一间同样舒适的起坐间里，那么柯林斯先生待在自己房间里的时间就要比较少了；她很赞赏夏绿蒂这样的按排。
From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.	她们从会客室里根本看不见外面大路的情形，幸亏每逢有什么车辆驶过，柯林斯先生总是要告诉她们;特别是德·包尔小姐常常乘着小马车驶过，差不多天天驶过，他没有哪一次不告诉她们的。小姐常在牧师的门前停下车来，跟夏绿蒂闲谈几分钟，可是主人从来不请她下车。
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	柯林斯先生差不多每天要到罗新斯去一趟，他的太太也是隔不了几天就要去一次。伊丽莎白总以为他们还有些别的应得的俸禄要去处理一下，否则她就不懂得为什么要牺牲那么多的时间。有时候夫人也会光临他们的住宅，来了以后就把屋子里无论什么事都看在眼里。她查问他们的日常生活，察看他们的家务，劝他们换个方式处置;又吹毛求疵地说，他们的家具摆得不对，或者是他们的佣人在偷懒;要是她肯在这里吃点东西，那好象只是为了要看看柯林斯太太是否持家节俭，不滥吃滥用。
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.	伊丽莎白立刻就发觉，这位贵妇人虽然没有担任郡里的司法职使，可是事实上她等于是她自己这个教区里最积极的法官，一点点芝麻大的事都由柯林斯先生报告给她;只要哪一个穷苦人在吵架，闹意气，或是穷得活不下去，她问题亲自到村里去调解处理，镇压制服，又骂得他们一个个相安无事，不再叫苦叹穷。
"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me."	“伊丽莎，这次贵客光临，我得感谢你呀。否则达西先生才不会一下子就来拜访我呢。”
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	伊丽莎白听到这番恭维话，还没有来得及申辩，门铃就响了，宣布贵宾光临。不大一会儿工夫，宾主三人一同走进屋来。带头的是费茨威廉上校，大约三十岁左右，人长得不漂亮，可是从仪表和谈吐看来，倒是个地道的绅士。达西先生完全是当初在哈福德郡的那副老样子，用他往常一贯的矜持态度，向柯林斯太太问好。尽管他对她的朋友伊丽莎白可能另有一种感情，然而见到她的时候，神色却极其镇定。伊丽莎白只对他行了个屈膝礼，一句话也没说。
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body. At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added,	Fitzwilliam上校立刻就跟大家攀谈起来，口齿伶俐，象个有教养的人，并且谈得颇有风趣;可是他那位表兄，却只跟柯林斯太太把房子和花园稍许评赏了几句，就坐那儿没有跟任何人说话。过了一会儿，他重新想到了礼貌问题，便向伊丽莎白问候她和她全家人的安好。伊丽莎白照例敷衍了他几句，停了片刻，她又说：
"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never happened to see her there?"	“我姐姐最近三个月来一直在城里。你从来没有碰到过她吗?”
She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.	她明明知道他从来没有碰到过吉英，只不过为了想要探探他的口气，看看他是否知道彬格莱一家人和吉英之间的关系。他回答说，不幸从来未曾碰到过班纳特小姐，她觉得他回答这话时神色有点慌张。这件事没有再谈下去，两位贵宾立刻就告辞了。

Simultaneously a thrilling piece of travel literature and a philosophical treatise, Robert M. Pirsig’s 1974 novel Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance traces the author’s bike trip from Minnesota to California. Interspersed with vivid sweeps of the American prairies, each chapter also chronicles a series of philosophical discussions as a father recovering from electroconvulsive therapy gradually tries to reconcile his own worldviews with those of the people around him and liberation from a materialist spiritual vacuum. Drawing on both the Western and Eastern philosophical canon, this challenging read ultimately serves as a platform for Pirsig to introduce his own Metaphysics of Quality.	这是一部很有意思的旅游文学作品，也可以被看作一篇哲学论文。波西格74年出版的长篇小说《禅与摩托车维修艺术》描绘了作者从美国明尼苏达州到加州的一段骑行之旅。除了对北美莽莽大草原的生动描述，每一章里，波西格还针对一系列哲理性话题进行了探讨。随着作者的讨论，主人公——一位从电痉挛治疗中逐渐恢复的父亲，不断尝试协调自己和周围人的世界观，并试图摆脱物质文化带给他的空虚感。波西格借用东西方的哲学论点，阐述了自己的“质量形而上学论”，虽然要看懂相当不易，一旦读完却绝对会受益匪浅。
Just because we might not be aware of such adult messages when we read books as kids, doesn't mean we aren't absorbing them, she adds. "However far this kind of 'message' seems to leap out at the adult reader, it is probably closer to the truth to say that the message has always been there but the knowledge that allows it to be recognised has not."	只是因为儿时读这类书籍时，可能还没意识到这类成人信息，但这并不是说我们没有受它们影响。她补充道。"而这些潜台词似乎并不会直接跳入成人眼中。更确切地说，这些潜在信息一直都在那里，但是需要有相应的知识去辨识出来。"
Of course, sometimes meanings seem hidden because we're too caught up in the story, or because we're simply too young. Only as an adult does Waller recognise the motivation of Max's mother in sending him to bed without supper when she reads Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are.	当然，有时候这些潜在的信息无法察觉，是因为太过于沉浸在故事情节中，或是因为我们还太年轻。所以，沃勒博士只有从成年人的角度再次翻阅莫里斯·森达克的《野兽家园》，她才明白书中马克思妈妈把他送上床却没有吃晚饭这件事上的动机。
As a child many of my favourite books had food as a theme. One in particular told the story of a boy who helped save his local burger bar by becoming a gastro-sleuth to track down a lost secret ingredient.	小时候，我最喜欢看的是以食物为主题的书。令我印象尤为深刻的一个故事是：有一个小男孩为了拯救当地的汉堡店，从而化身为“味觉侦探”去寻找遗失的秘方。
It was my book. Except that it wasn't – not really. While burgers do indeed feature in lip-smacking detail, this time it was clear to me that The Perfect Hamburger is actually a tale of corporate greed and the fate of small businesses forced to compete with big chains.	这就是我说的那本小说。其实不是——至少不完全是。小时候我觉得这是一个关于美味的汉堡的故事，而如今我再次读它，看到的却是一个大企业的贪婪以及小企业被迫同大型连锁店竞争的悲惨命运。

"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!"	“说老实话，”他说，“她老人家邀请我们星期日去吃茶点，在罗新斯消磨一个下午，我一点儿也不觉得意外。她一贯为人殷勤，我倒以为她真要这样招待一番的，可是谁料想到会象这次这样情意隆重?谁会想到你们刚刚到这里在，就被请到那边去吃饭(而且全体都请到了)?”
"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."	“刚才的事我倒不怎么觉得稀奇，”，William说，“大人物的为人处世实在都是如此，象我这样有身份的人，就见识得很多。在显宦贵族们当中，这类风雅好客的事不足为奇。”
Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day, or next morning, but their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	这一整天和第二天上午，简直只谈到去罗新斯的事。柯林斯先生预先仔仔细细地一样样告诉他们，到那边去将要看到什么东西，免得他们看到了那样宏伟的屋子，那样众多的仆从，那样丰盛的菜肴，会造成临时慌乱，手足失措。
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,	当娘儿们正要各自去打扮的时候，他又对伊丽莎白说：
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved."	“不要为衣装担心思，亲爱的表妹。咖苔琳夫人才不会要我们穿得华丽呢，这只有她自己和她的女儿才配。我劝你只要在你自己的衣服里面，拣一件出色的穿上就行，不必过于讲究。珈苔琳夫人决不会因为你衣装朴素就瞧你不起。她喜欢各人守着自己的本份，分得出一个高低。”
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. -- Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at St. James's.	她们整装的时候，他又到各个人的房门口去了两三次，劝她们快一点，因为咖苔琳夫人请人吃饭最恨客人迟到。玛丽亚·卢卡斯听说她老人家的为人处事这样可怕，不由得吓了一跳，因为她一向不大会应酬。她一想起要到罗新斯去拜望，就诚惶诚恐，正如她父亲当年进宫觐见一样。
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. -- Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.	他们踏上台阶走进穿堂的时候，玛丽亚一分钟比一分钟来得惶恐，连威廉爵士也不能完全保持镇定。倒是伊丽莎白不畏缩。无论是论才论德，她都没有听到咖苔琳夫人有什么了不起的地方足以引起她敬畏，光凭着有钱有势，还不会叫她见到了就胆战心惊。
From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. -- Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.	进了穿堂，柯林斯先生就带着一副喜极欲狂的神气，指出这屋子的堂皇富丽，然后由佣人们带着客人走过前厅，来到咖苔琳夫人母女和姜金生太太的起坐间。夫人极其谦和地站起身来迎接他们。根据柯林斯太太事先跟她丈夫商量好的办法，当场由太太出面替宾主介绍，因此介绍得很得体，凡是柯林斯先生认为必不可少的那些道歉和感激的话，都一概免了。
In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. -- Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.	威廉爵士虽说当年也曾进宫觐见过皇上，可是看到四周围这般的富贵气派，也不禁完全给吓住了，只得弯腰一躬，一声不响，坐了下来;再说他的女儿，简直吓得丧魂失魄一般，兀自坐在椅子边上，眼睛也不知道往哪里看才好。伊丽莎白倒是完全安然自若，而且从容不迫地细细瞧着那三位女主人。咖苔琳夫人是位高大的妇人，五官清楚，也许年轻时很好看。她的样子并不十分客气，接待宾客的态度也不能使宾客忘却自己身份的低微。她吓人的地方倒不是默不作声，而是她出言吐语时声调总是那么高高在上，自命不凡，这叫伊丽莎白立刻想起了韦翰先生的话。经过这一整天的察言观色之后，她觉得咖苔琳夫人的为人，果然和韦翰所形容的完全一样。
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.	坐了几分钟以后，客人们都被打发到窗口去欣赏外面的风景。柯林斯先生陪着他们，一处处指给他们看，咖苔琳夫人和善地告诉他们说，到了夏天还要好看。
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. -- He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh -- the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	酒席果然特别体面，待候的仆从以及盛酒菜的器皿，也跟柯林斯先生所形容过的一模一样，而且正如他事先所料到的那样，夫人果然吩咐他坐在末席，看他那副神气，好象人生没有比这更得意的事了。他边切边吃，又兴致淋漓地赞不绝口;每一道菜都由他先来夸奖，然后由威廉爵士加以吹嘘，原来威廉爵士现在已经完全消除了惊恐，可以做他女婿的应声虫了。伊丽莎白看到那种样子，不禁担心咖苔琳夫人怎么受得了。可是咖苔琳夫人对这些过分的赞扬好象倒非常满意，总是显露出仁慈的微笑，尤其是端上一道客人们没见过的菜到桌上来的时候，她便格外得意。宾主们都没有什么可谈的，伊丽莎白却只要别人开个头，总还有话可说，可惜她坐的地方不对头，一边是夏绿蒂，她正在用心听咖苔琳夫人谈话;另一边是德·包尔小姐，整个吃饭时间不跟她说一句话。姜金生太太主要在注意德·包尔小姐，她看到小姐东西吃得太少，便逼着她吃了这样再吃那样，又怕她不受用。玛丽亚根本不想讲话，男客们只顾一边吃一边赞美。
When the ladies returned to the drawing room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted. She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name? -- Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly. -- Lady Catherine then observed,	女客们回到会客室以后，只是听咖苔琳夫人谈话。夫人滔滔不绝地一直谈到咖啡端上来为止，随便谈到哪一桩事，她总是那么斩钉截铁、不许别人反对的样子。她毫不客气地仔细问着夏绿蒂的家常，又给她提供了一大堆关于料理家务的意见。她告诉夏绿蒂说，象她这样的一个小家庭，一切事情都应该精密安排，又指教她如何照料母牛和家禽。伊丽莎白发觉这位贵妇人只要有机会支配别人，随便怎么小的事情也决不肯轻易放过。夫人同柯林斯太太谈话的时候，也间或向玛丽亚和伊丽莎白问几句话，特别向伊丽莎白问得多。她不大清楚伊丽莎白和她们是什么关系，不过她对柯林斯太太说，她是个很斯文、很标致的姑娘。她好几次问伊丽莎白有几个姐妹，她们比她大还是比她小，她们中间有没有哪一个已经结婚，她们长得好看不好看，在哪里读书，她们的父亲有什么样的马车，她母亲的娘家姓什么。伊丽莎白觉得她这些话问得唐突，不过还是心平气和地回答了她。于是咖苔琳夫人说：
"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. -- It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. -- Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?"	“你父亲的财产得由柯林斯先生继承吧，我想?”──说到这里，她又掉过头来对夏绿蒂说：“为你着想，我倒觉得高兴;否则我实在看不出有什么理由不让自己的女儿们来继承财产，却要给别人。刘威斯·德·包尔家里就觉得没有这样做的必要。──你会弹琴唱歌吗，班纳特小姐?”
"Oh! then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to -- You shall try it some day. -- Do your sisters play and sing?"	“噢，几时我们倒想要听一听。我们的琴非常好，说不定比──你哪一天来试一试看吧。你的姐妹们会弹琴唱歌吗?”
"Why did not you all learn? -- You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your's. -- Do you draw?"	“为什么不大家都学呢?你们应该个个都学。魏伯家的小姐们就个个都会，她们父亲的收入还比不上你们父亲呢。你们会画吗?”
"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."	“这倒很稀奇。我猜想你们是没有机会学吧。你们的母亲应该每年春天带你们上城里来投投名师才对。”
"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."	“我妈是不会反对的，可是我父亲厌恶伦敦。”
"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess! -- I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education."	“没有女家庭教师!那怎么行?家里教养着五个姑娘，却不请个女家庭教师!我从来没听到过这样的事!你妈简直是做奴隶似的教育你们啦。”
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.	伊丽莎白禁不住笑起来了，一面告诉她说，事实并不是那样。
"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess you must have been neglected."	“那么谁教导你们呢?谁服待你们呢?没有一个女家庭老师，你们不就是没人照管了吗?”
"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."	“同别的一些人家比较起来，我们家里待我们算是比较懈怠;可是姐妹们中间，凡是好学的，决不会没有办法。家里经常鼓励我们好好读书，必要的教师我们都有。谁要是存心偷懒，当然也可以。”
"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss pope a treasure. "Lady Catherine," said she, "you have given me a treasure." Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"	“那是毫无疑问的;不过，女家庭教师的任务也就是为了防止这种事情;要是我认识你们的母亲，我一定要竭力劝她请一位。我总以为缺少了按部就班的指导，教育就不会有任何成绩，而按部就班的指导就只有女家庭教师办得到。说起来也怪有意思，多少人家都是由我介绍女家庭教师的。我一贯喜欢让一个年轻人得到很好的安插。姜金生太太的四个侄女儿都由我给她们介绍了称心如意的位置;就在前几天，我又推荐了一个姑娘，她不过是人家偶然在我面前提起的，那家人家对她非常满意。──柯林斯太太，我有没有告诉过你，麦特卡尔夫人昨天来谢我?她觉得蒲白小姐真是件珍宝呢。她跟我说：‘咖苔琳夫人，你给了我一件珍宝。’──你的妹妹们有没有哪一个已经出来交际了，班纳特小姐?”
"All! -- What, all five out at once? Very odd! -- And you only the second. -- The younger ones out before the elder are married! -- Your younger sisters must be very young?"	“全都出来交际了!什么，五个姐妹同时出来交际?真奇怪!你不过是第二个!姐姐还没有嫁人，妹妹就出来交际了!你的妹妹们一定还很小吧?”
"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. perhaps she is full young to be much in company. But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. -- The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first. And to be kept back on such a motive! -- I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."	“是的;最小的一个才十六岁。或许她还太小，不适宜多交朋友。不过，太太，要是因为姐姐们无法早嫁，或是不想早嫁，做妹妹的就不能有社交和娱乐，那实在太苦了她们。最小的和最大的同样有消受青春的权利。怎么能为了这样的原由，就叫她们死守在家里!我以为那样做就不可能促进姐妹之间的情感，也不可能养成温柔的性格。”
"Upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. -- pray, what is your age?"	“真想不到，”夫人说，“你这么小的一个人，倒这样有主见。请问你几岁啦?”
"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."	“我已经有了三个成人的妹妹，”伊丽莎白笑着说。“你老人家总不会再要我招出年纪来了吧。”
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence!	Catherine夫人没有得到直截了当的回答，显得很惊奇;伊丽莎白觉得敢于和这种没有礼貌的富贵太太开玩笑，恐怕要推她自己为第一个人。
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, -- therefore you need not conceal your age."	“你不会超过二十岁，我确定——所以你也不必瞒年纪。”
When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the other table, Lady Catherine was generally speaking -- stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.	等到喝过茶，男客们都到她们这边来了，便摆起牌桌来。咖苔琳夫人、威廉爵士和柯林斯夫妇坐下来打“夸锥”;德·包尔小姐要玩“卡西诺”，因此两位姑娘就很荣幸地帮着姜金生太太给她凑足了人数。她们这一桌真是枯燥无味，除了姜金生太太问问德·包尔小姐是否觉得太冷或太热，是否感到灯光太强或太弱以外，就没有一句话不是说到打牌方面的。另外一桌可就有声有色得多了。咖苔琳夫人差不多一直都在讲话，不是指出另外三个人的错处，就是讲些自己的趣闻轶事。她老人家说一句，柯林斯先生就附和一句，他赢一次要谢她一次，如果赢得太多，还得向她道歉。威廉爵士不大说话，只顾把一桩桩轶事和一个个高贵的名字装进脑子里去。
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands.	等到咖苔琳夫人母女俩玩得不想再玩的时候，两桌牌桌就散场了，打发马车送柯林斯太太回去，柯林斯太太很感激地接受了，于是马上叫人去套车。大家又围着火炉，听咖苔琳夫人断定明天的天气怎么样。等到马车来了，叫他们上车，他们方始停止受训。柯林斯先生说了多少感激的话，威廉爵士鞠了多少躬，大家方才告别。马车一走出门口，柯林斯就要求伊丽莎白发表她对于罗新斯的感想，她看在夏绿蒂面上，便勉强敷衍了他几句。她虽然勉为其难地说出了一大篇好话，却完全不能叫柯林斯先生满意，柯林斯没有办法，只得立刻亲自开口，把老夫人大大重新赞扬了一番。
The weepy American canine classic Old Yeller by Fred Gipson is immediately given a 'spoiler alert' with the comment: "The dog dies."	有人给那本让美国人潸然泪下的、由弗莱德·吉普森所著的犬类经典作品《老黄狗》写上带有“前方剧透高能”的评论：“这只狗死了”。
The Sun Also Rises also elicited ire, noted one reader: "This book reads like a series of Twitter posts by an arrogant alcoholic hanging around with his irresponsible alcoholic friends.”	《太阳照常升起》也引起了人们的愤怒，一个读者评论到：“这本书读起来真的像是一个傲慢的酒鬼和他那些不负责任的酒鬼朋友们在推特上发的状态。”
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory review: "Willy Wonka is a psychotic sadistic child-hating manchild with a penchant for third world labor.”	《查理和巧克力工厂》的评论写到：“威利·旺卡是一个精神虐待狂，厌恶小孩的大小孩，对第三世界的劳动力情有独钟。”
John Steinbeck's renowned Of Mice And Men set during the Great Depression was damned with: "If I want to be depressed, I’ll just think, not read.”	约翰·斯坦贝克的著名《人鼠之间》以大萧条时代为背景，竟被人骂成：“如果我想让自己不高兴，我只会想一下，而不是看书。”
As for Victor Hugo's Gothic romance, The Hunchback of Notre Dame: "There were too much describings,” complained the reader.	对于维克多·雨果的哥特式罗曼史物语《巴黎圣母院》书中的敲钟驼背人卡西莫多，读者抱怨道：“里面描述性的东西太多了。”
Perhaps the most upsetting for book lovers would be the comment on Charle's Darwin's Origin of the Species: "Didn’t like the cover.”	可能最让爱好读书的人伤心的是有人对查尔斯·达尔文《物种起源》的评论了：“不喜欢这个封面。”
In the spirit of Halloween, we gathered up a few books that are psychologically eerie in the way some horror movies just aren't.	万圣节即将到来之际，为了渲染节日氛围，我们精选了几本适合此时赏读的恐怖小说，这些小说不同于某些恐怖电影，都以心理上的恐怖感取胜。
Jessica buys a runt of a kitten -- a tiny creature that her neighbor helps her nurse to health. Adorable, right? NO. WRONG. There is nothing adorable about this story. Jessica names the kitten Worm, which is already a horrible sign. Then, timed perfectly with her acquisition of said kitten, Jessica begins committing increasingly violent acts against her family.	杰西卡买了一只小猫崽——她的邻居也来帮助她饲养这只小东西。听起来很萌萌哒，不是吗——然并卵！这个故事一点也不萌萌哒。杰西卡为小猫取名为“虫子”，这本身就是一个恐怖的征兆了。接着，恰在她将这只小猫带回家之后，杰西卡开始对家人施暴，而且暴力倾向越来越严重。
EVERY object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	第二天旅途上的每一样事物，伊丽莎白都感到新鲜有趣；她精神很愉快，因为看到姐姐气色那么好，可以不用再为她的健康担心，加上一想到去北方的旅行，她就越发高兴。
When they left the high-road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	当他们离开了大路，走上一条通往汉斯福的小径时，每一只眼睛都在寻找着那幢牧师住宅；每拐一个弯，都以为就要看到那幢房子。他们沿着罗新斯花园的栅栏往前走。伊丽莎白一想到外界所传闻的那家人家和种种情形，不禁好笑。
At length the parsonage was discernable. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, everything declared that they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at a small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	终于看到那幢牧师住宅了。大路斜对面的花园、花园里的房子、绿的栅栏、以及桂树围篱───每一样东西好象都在宣布他们的来到。柯林斯先生和夏绿蒂走到门口来了。在宾主频频点头脉脉微笑中，客人们在一道小门跟前停下了车，从这里穿过一条短短的鹅卵石铺道，便能直达正屋。一刹眼工夫，他们都下了车，宾主相见，无限欢欣。柯林斯简直手舞足蹈地欢迎自己的朋友，伊丽莎白受到这么亲切的欢迎，就越发满意于这次的作客了。她立刻看到她表兄并没有因为结了婚而改变态度，他还是完全和以往一样地拘泥礼节，在门口耽搁了她好几分钟，问候她全家大小的起居安好。听到她一一回答了之后，他才满意。于是他就没有再耽搁他们，只指给他们看看门口是多么整洁，便把客人们带进了屋子;等到客人一走进客厅，他又对他们作了第二次的欢迎，极其客气地说，这次承蒙诸位光临寒舍，真是不胜荣幸，并且刻不容缓地把他太太送上来的点心重新奉献了一次。
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the excercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.	伊丽莎白早就料到他会那样得意非凡，因此当他夸耀那屋子的优美结构、式样、以及一切陈设的时候，她禁不住想到他是特地讲给她听的，好象要叫她明白，她当初拒绝了他，是多么大的一个损失。虽说样样东西的确都那么整洁和舒适，她可千万不能流露出一点点后悔的痕迹来叫他得意;她甚至带着诧异的目光看看夏绿蒂，她弄不明白夏绿蒂和这样的一位伴侣相处，为什么还会那么高兴。柯林斯先生有时竟会说些很不得体的话，叫他自己的太太听了也不免难为情，而且这类话又说得并不太少，每逢这种场合，伊丽莎白就不由自主地要向夏绿蒂望一眼。夏绿蒂有一两次被她看得微微脸红了，不过一般总是很聪明地装作没有听见。大家在屋里坐了好一会儿，欣赏着每一件家具，从食器橱一直欣赏到壁炉架，又谈了谈一路上的情况以及伦敦的一切情形，然后柯林斯先生就请他们到花园里去散散步。花园很大，布置得也很好，一切都是由他亲手料理的。他的最高尚的娱乐就是收拾花园。夏绿蒂说，这种操作有益于健康，她尽可能鼓励他这样做;她讲起这件事的时候，非常镇定自若，真叫伊丽莎白佩服。他领着他们走遍了花园里的曲径小道，看遍了每一处景物，每看一处都得琐琐碎碎地讲一阵，美不美倒完全不在他心上，看的人即使想要赞美几句也插不上嘴。他数得出每一个方向有多少田园，连最远的树丛里有多少棵树他也讲得出来，可是，不论是他自己花园里的景物也好，或者是这整个乡村甚至全国的名胜古迹也好，都万万比不上罗新斯花园的景色。罗新斯花园差不多就在他住宅的正对面，四面是树，从树林的空隙处可以望见里面。那是一幢漂亮的控建筑，耸立在一片高地上。
"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."	“正是，伊丽莎白小姐，星期日晚上你就可以有荣幸在教学里见到咖苔琳·德·包尔夫人，你一定会喜欢她的。她为人极其谦和，丝毫没有架子，我相信那天做完礼拜之后，你就会很荣幸地受到她的注目。我可以毫无犹豫地说，只要你待在这儿，每逢她赏脸请我们作客的时候，总少不了要请你和我的小姨子玛丽亚。她对待我亲爱的夏绿蒂真是好极了。我们每星期去罗新斯吃两次饭，她老人家从来没有哪一次让我们步行回家，总是打发自己的马车送我们──我应该说，是打发她老人家的某一部马车，因为她有好几部车子呢。”
"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."	夏绿蒂又说：“咖苔琳夫人的确是个道貌岸然、通达情理的女人，而且是位极其殷勤的邻居。”
"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."	“说得很对，亲爱的，你真说到我心上去了。象她这样一位夫人，你无论对她怎样尊敬，依旧会感到有些欠缺。”
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.	这一晚主要就谈论哈福德郡的新闻，又把以前信上所说的话重新再提一遍。大家散了以后，伊丽莎白孤单单地在房间里，不由得默默想起了夏绿蒂对于现状究竟满意到什么程度，驾御丈夫的手腕巧妙到什么程度，容忍丈夫的肚量又大到什么程度。她不由得承认，一切都安排得非常好。她又去想象着这次作客的时间将如何度过，无非是：平淡安静的日常起居，柯林斯先生那种惹人讨厌的插嘴打贫，再加上跟罗新斯的应酬来往等。她那丰富的想象力马上解决了整个问题。
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out：	大约在第二天响午的时候，她正在房间里准备出去散散步，忽听得楼下一阵喧哗，马上这整个住宅里的人好象都慌乱了起来;一会儿工夫，只听得有人急急忙忙奔上楼来，大声叫她。她开了门，在楼梯口遇见了玛丽亚，只见她激动得气都喘不过来，嚷道：
"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment."	“噢，亲爱的伊丽莎呀，请你赶快到餐室里去，那儿有了不起的场面值得看呢！我可不告诉你是怎么回事。赶快呀，马上下楼来。”
Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.	伊丽莎白一遍遍问，也问不出一个究竟来；玛丽亚多一句也不肯跟她说；于是她们俩便奔进那间面临着大路的餐室，去探奇寻胜。原来来了两位女客，乘着一辆低低的四轮马车，停在花园门口。
"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth. "I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!"	“就是这么回事吗?”伊丽莎白连忙嚷道：“我还以为是猪猡闯进了花园呢，原来只不过是咖苔琳夫人母女俩。”
"La! my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The other is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"	玛丽亚听她说错了，不禁大吃一惊：“噍你，亲爱的，那不是咖苔琳夫人。那位老夫人是姜金生太太，她跟她们住在一起的；另外一位是德·包尔小姐。你且瞧瞧她那副模样儿吧。她真是个非常纤小的人儿。谁会想到她会这么单薄，这么小！”
"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?"	“她真是太没有礼貌，风这样大，却让夏绿蒂待在门外。她为什么不进来？”
"Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in."	“噢，Charlotte说道，她真难得进来。德·包尔小姐要是进来一次，那可真是天大的面子。”
Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.	柯林斯先生和夏绿蒂都站在门口跟那位女客谈话。伊丽莎白觉得最好笑的是，威廉爵士正必恭必敬地站在门口，虔诚地瞻仰着面前的蔚然大观，每当德·包尔小姐朝着他这边望的时候，他总是一鞠躬。
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.	后来他们的话全说完了，两位女客驱车而去，别人都回到屋里。柯林斯一看到两位小姐，就恭贺她们走了鸿运；夏绿蒂把他的意思解释给她们听，原来罗新斯明天又要请他们全体去吃饭了。
WITH no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.	浪搏恩这家人家除了这些事以外，再没有别的大事;除了到麦里屯去散散步以外，再没有别的消遣。时而雨水泞途、时而风寒刺骨的正月和二月，就这样过去了。三月里伊丽莎白要上汉斯福去。开头她并不是真想去;可是她立刻想到夏绿蒂对于原来的约定寄予了很大的期望，于是她也就带着比较乐意和比较肯定的心情来考虑这个问题了。离别促进了她想夏绿蒂重逢的愿望，也消除了她对柯林斯先生的厌恶。这个计划多少总有它新奇的地方;再说，家里有了这样的母亲和这样几位不能融洽的妹妹，自难完美无缺，换换环境也好。趁着旅行的机会也可去看看吉英;总之，时日迫近了，她反而有些等不及了。她在一切都进行得很顺利，最后依旧照了夏绿蒂原先的意思，跟威廉爵士和他的第二个女儿一块儿去作一次客。以后这计划又补充了一下，决定在伦敦住一夜，这一来可真是个十全十美的计划了。
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	只有和父亲离别使她感到痛苦，父亲一定会记挂她。说起来，他根本就不愿意让她去，既是事情已经决定，只得叫她常常写信给他，而且几乎答应亲自给她回信。
The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of every body -- would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.	她跟韦翰先生告别时，双方都十分客气，韦翰比她还要客气。他目前虽然在追求别人，却并没有因此就忘了伊丽莎白是第一个引起他注目的人，第一个值得他注目的人，第一个听他倾诉衷情，第一个可怜他，第一个搏得了他爱慕的人;他向她告别，祝她万事如意，又对她说了一遍德·包尔夫人是很好的一个人，他相信他们俩对那位老夫人的评价，对每一个人的评价，一定完全吻合。他说这话的时候，显得很是热诚，很是关切，这种盛情一定会使她对他永远怀着极其深挚的好感。他们分手以后，她更相信不管他结婚也罢，单身也罢，他在她的心目中将会始终是一个极其和蔼可亲而又讨人喜欢的人。
Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information.	第二天和她同路的那些人，也并没有使韦翰在她心目中相形见绌。威廉爵士简直说不出一句中听的话，他那位女儿玛丽亚虽然脾气很好，脑子却象她父亲一样空洞，也说不出一句中听的话。听他们父女俩说话，就好象听到车辆的辘辘声一样无聊。伊丽莎白本来爱听无稽之谈，不过威廉爵士那一套她实在听得腻了。他谈来谈去总不外乎觐见皇上以及荣膺爵士头衔之类的奇闻，翻不出什么新花样来;他那一套礼貌举止，也象他的出言吐语一样，已经陈腐不堪。
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.	这段旅程不过二十四英里路，他们启程很早，为的是要在正午赶到天恩寺街。他们走近嘉丁纳先生的大门时，吉英正在会客室的窗口望着他们。他们走近过道时，吉英正等在那儿接他们，伊丽莎白真挚地仔细望了望吉英的脸，只见那张脸蛋儿还是象往常一样地健康美丽，她觉得很高兴。男男女女的孩子们为了急于要见到表奶，在客厅里等不及，又因为一年没见面，不好意思下楼去，便都待在楼梯口。到处是一片欢乐与和善的气氛。这一天真过得极其愉快;上午乱哄哄地忙做一团，又要出去买东西;晚上上戏院去看戏。
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.	伊丽莎白在舅母身旁坐下来。她们俩首先就谈到她姐姐。她仔仔细细问了许多话，舅母回答她说，吉英虽然竭力提着精神，还免不了有意气消沉的时候，她听了并不十分诧异，却很忧郁。她在这种意气消沉的现象还会继续多久。嘉丁纳太太也跟伊丽莎白谈起彬格莱小姐过访天恩寺街的一切情形，又把吉英跟她好几次的谈话重述了一遍给她听，这些话足以说明吉英的确打算再不和彬格莱小姐来往了。
Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.	嘉丁纳太太然后又谈起韦翰遗弃伊丽莎白的话，把她外甥女笑话了一番，同时又赞美她的忍耐功夫。
"pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary."	“请问你，亲爱的舅母，拿婚姻问题来讲，见钱眼红与动机正当究竟有什么不同?做到什么地步为止就算知礼，打哪儿起就要算是贪心?去年圣诞节你还生怕我跟他结婚，怕的是不郑重其事，而现在呢，他要去跟一个只不过有一万镑财产的姑娘结婚，你就要说他见不得钱啦。”
"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think."	“只要你告诉我，金小姐是怎么样一个姑娘，我就知道该怎么说话了。”
"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her."	“我相信她是个好姑娘。我说不出她有什么坏处。”
"No -- why should he? If it was not allowable for him to gain my affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"	“没有的事——他为什么要那样?要是说，他不愿意跟我相爱，就是因为我没有钱，那么，他一向不关心的一个姑娘，一个同样穷的姑娘，他又有什么理由要去跟她谈恋爱呢?”
"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event."	“不过，她家里一发生这件事，他就去向她献殷勤，这未免不象话吧。”
"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe. If she does not object to it, why should we?"	“一个处境困难的人，不会象一般人那样有闲，去注意这些繁文缛节。只要她不反对，我们为什么要反对?”
"Her not objecting, does not justify him. It only shews her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling."	“她不反对，并不说明他就做得对。那只不过说明了她本身有什么缺陷，不是见识方面有缺陷，就是感觉方面有缺陷。”
"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish."	“哦，”伊丽莎白叫道：“你爱怎么说就怎么说吧，说他贪财也好，说她傻也好。”
"No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."	“不，Lizzy，我才不这么说呢。你知道，在德比郡住了这么久的一个青年，我是不忍心说他坏话的。”
"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all."	“噢，要是光光就凭这点理由，我才看不起那些住在德比郡的青年人呢，他们住在哈福德郡的那批知已朋友们，也好不了多少。他们全都叫我讨厌。谢谢老天爷!明天我就要到一个地方去，我将要在那儿见到一个一无可取的人，他无论在风度方面，在见解方面，都不见长。说到头来，只有那些傻瓜值得你去跟他们来来往往。”
"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."	“当心些，丽萃;这种话未免说得太消沉了些。”
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	她们看完了戏，刚要分手的时候，舅父母又邀请她参加他们的夏季旅行，这真是一种意外的快乐。
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs. Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes."	“至于究竟到什么地方去，我们还没有十分决定”，嘉丁纳太太说：“也许到湖区去。”
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. "My dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing. We will know where we have gone -- we will recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation. Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."	对伊丽莎白说来，随便什么计划也不会比这个计划更中她的意了，她毫不犹豫地接受了这个邀请，而且非常感激。“我的好舅母，亲舅母，”她欢天喜地叫了起来，“多高兴，多幸福!你给了我新的生命和活力。我再也不沮丧和忧郁了。人比起高山大石来，算得了什么?我们将要度过一些多么快乐的时日啊!等到我们回来的时候，一定不会象一般游人那样，什么都是浮光惊影。我们一定会知道到过什么地方───我们看见过的东西一定会记得住。湖泊山川决不会在我们脑子里乱七八糟地混做一团;我们要谈到某一处风景的时候，决不会连位置也弄不明白，彼此争论不休。但愿我们一回来叙述起游踪浪迹的时候，不要象一般旅客那样陈腔滥调，叫人听不入耳。”
1. "The Wine of Wisdom: The Life, Poetry and Philosophy of Omar Khayyam"	《酒的智慧：Omar Khayyam的人生、诗歌和哲学》
Khayyám's poem is as well-known for its soul-searching beauty as for the fact that a mathematician wrote it. Explorations of life's temporary nature jogs elbows with alcohol, as the author strives to make sense of the call of religion versus the immediacy of death – and the folly of trying to find Paradise on earth.	正如人人都知道这诗歌出自数学家之手，同样，莪默·伽亚谟的诗歌因其追寻灵魂之美而广为人知。对于生命转瞬即逝的本质探寻引发了杯酒之欢，作者试图理解宗教的召唤和突如其来的死亡间的关系，探究缘何人们愚笨地在地球上寻求天堂。
This is one of the best allegorical novels to explain the fractured nature of 19th century Russia. Each character is representative of one of the ruling classes. There is the father Fyodor, the landowner who is negligent about his land, but greedy in using its produce for himself. There's Dmitri, who has been passed around from house to house, and has grown up an entitled but debt-ridden soul. There's the skeptic Ivan, who wishes to live more than people. Third is gentle Alyosha, the mystic and religious peacemaker, and the illegitimate Smerdyakov. Through out are themes of love, law, and duty, which makes this one of the best Dostoyesky books to read besides Crime and Punishment.	这是最好的寓言小说之一，阐述了19世纪俄国分崩离析的本质。每个角色都是统治阶级的代表之一。父亲费多尔是个疏于耕种的地主，却贪婪地一心要把作物占为己用。德米特里，挨家挨户游荡，长大成人虽有权利在握，却心债累累。满腹狐疑的伊凡，整日想着要比起别人活得更长。老三阿廖沙性格温和，信仰宗教，是个和事佬；还有私生子麦尔佳科夫。贯穿全书的主题是情爱、法律和责任，这让其成为陀思妥耶夫斯基《罪与罚》之外最值得一读的书籍。
This is Dostoyevsky's second most famous work (besides Brothers Karamasov), and also centers around a crime and a court case. Roskolnikov, a student deeply in debt and intellectual and moral issues, has a mad desire to kill the pawnbroker who owns some of his valuables, in order to pay his landlady. There are plenty of family and social issues to be explored, including the link between prostitution and arranged family marriages, the downward spiral of madness, and the nature of poverty and charity.	这是陀思妥耶夫斯基（《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》之外）第二大名著，围绕罪行和法院讼案展开。拉斯柯尔尼科夫是个债台高筑的学生，深陷学识和道德问题的泥沼。他想付房租，而他的财物不少在当铺老板那里，疯狂之下，拉斯柯尔尼科夫动了杀机，欲杀害当铺老板。书中有许多家庭和社会问题有待剖析，如嫖娼和包办婚姻之间的联系，不断恶化的精神失常问题，及贫穷与慈善的本质。
More humanly centered than his other well-known work, War and Peace, Tolstoy makes it clear that life is far too complicated for easy handouts of mercy or judgment. The novel begins with a case of family brokenness and adultery. The contrast between Anna, who runs away with her lover Vronsky, and Lenin (who marries Vronsky's former romantic interest), is especially worth reading. As one falls, the other rises, seeming to imply that following one's heart is only as worthwhile as true morality is also followed.	比起另一部广为人知的作品《战争与和平》，这部作品更加以人为本。托尔斯泰明言生活复杂，不能轻松施以同情、给予判断。小说的开场是一个家庭的破裂和婚外情。安娜（与情人渥伦斯基私奔）与列文（娶了渥伦斯基先前的爱慕者）之间的反差最值得一读。一方兴起，一方衰落，似乎想要暗示只有遵从真正的道德时才能从心所欲。
MRS. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:	Gardiner太太一碰到有适当的机会和伊丽莎白单独谈话，总是善意地对外甥女进行忠告，把心里的话老老实实讲了出来，然后又接下去说：
"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is -- you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father."	“你是个非常懂事的孩子，丽萃，你不至于因为人家劝你谈恋爱要当心，你就偏偏要谈；因此我才敢向你说个明白。说正经话，你千万要小心。跟这种没有财产作为基础的人谈恋爱，实在非常莽撞，你千万别让自己堕上情网，也不要费尽心机使他堕入情网。我并不是说他的坏话──他倒是个再有趣不过的青年；要是他得到了他应当得到的那份财产，那我就会觉得你这门亲事再好也没有了。事实既是如此，你大可不必再对他想入非非。你很聪明，我们都希望你不要辜负了自己的聪明。我知道你父亲信任你品行好，又有决断，你切不可叫他失望。”
"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it."	“唔，你用不着急。我自己会当心，也会当心韦翰先生。只要我避免得了，我决不会叫他跟我恋爱。”
"I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw -- and if he becomes really attached to me -- I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. -- Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy! -- My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honor; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best."	“请原谅。让我重新讲讲看。目前我可并没有爱上韦翰先生；我的确没有。不过在我所看见的人当中，他的确是最可爱的一个，任谁也比不上他；如果他真会爱上我──我相信他还是不要爱上我的好。我看出了这件事很莽撞。噢！达西先生那么可恶！父亲这样器重我，真是我最大的荣幸，我要是辜负了他，一定会觉得遗憾。可是我父亲对韦翰也有成见。亲爱的舅母，总而言之，我决不愿意叫你们任何人为了我而不快活；不过，青年人一旦爱上了什么人，决不会因为暂时没有钱就肯撒手。要是我也给人家打动了心，我又怎能免俗?甚至我又怎么知道拒绝他是不是上策?因此，我只能答应你不仓忙从事就是了。我决不会一下子就认为我自己是他最中意的人。我虽然和他来往，可是决不会存这种心思。总而言之，我一定尽力而为。”
"perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not remind your mother of inviting him."　　	“假如你不让他来得这么勤，也许会好些；至少你不必提醒你母亲邀他来。”
Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented.	舅母告诉她说，这一下满意了；伊丽莎白谢谢她好心的指示，于是二人就分别了──在这种问题上给人家出主意而没受抱怨，这次倒可算一个稀罕的例子。
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she "wished they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,	嘉丁纳夫妇和吉英刚刚离开了哈德福郡，柯林斯先生就回到哈福德郡去。他住在卢卡斯府上，因此班纳特太太不但终于死了心，认为这门亲事是免不了的，甚至还几次三番恶意地说：“但愿他们会幸福吧。”星期四就是佳期，卢卡斯小姐星期三到班府上来辞行。当夏绿蒂起身告别的时候，伊丽莎白一方面由于母亲那些死样怪气的吉利话，使她听得不好意思，另一方面自己也委实有动无衷，便不由得送她走出房门。下楼梯的时候，夏绿蒂说：
"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."	“我相信你一定会常常给我写信的，伊丽莎。”　　
"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford."	“我可能暂时不会离开肯特郡。还是答应我上汉斯福来吧。”
Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.	伊丽莎白虽然预料到这种拜望不会有什么乐趣，可又没法推辞。
"My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them."	夏绿蒂又说：“我的父母三月里要到我那儿去，我希望你跟他们一块儿来。真的，伊丽莎，我一定象欢迎他们一样地欢迎你。”
The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.	结好了婚，新郎新娘从教堂门口直接动身往肯特郡去，大家总是照例你一句我一句的要说上多少话。伊丽莎白不久就收到了她朋友的来信，从此她们俩的通信便极其正常，极其频繁!不过，要象从前一样地畅所欲言，毫无顾忌，那可办不到了。伊丽莎白每逢写信给她，都免不了感觉到过去那种推心置腹的快慰已经成为陈迹;虽说她也下定决心，不要把通信疏懒下来，不过，那与其说是为了目前的友谊，倒不如说是为了过去的交情。她对于夏绿蒂开头的几封信都盼望得很迫切，那完全是出于一种好奇心，想要知道夏绿蒂所说的话，处处都和她自己所预料的完全一样。她的信写得充满了愉快的情调，讲到一件事总要赞美一句，好象她真有说不尽的快慰。凡是住宅、家具、邻居、道路，样样都叫她称心，咖苔琳夫人待人接物又是那么友善，那么亲切。她只不过把柯林斯先生所夸耀的汉斯福和罗新斯的面貌，稍许说得委婉一些罢了;伊丽莎白觉得，一定要等到亲自去那儿拜访，才能了解其他的。
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.	Jane早已来了一封短简给伊丽莎白，信上说，她已经平安抵达伦敦;伊丽莎白希望她下次来信能够讲一些有关Bingleys家的事。　
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost.	第二封信真等得她焦急，可是总算没有白等。信上说，她已经进城一个星期，既没有看见珈罗琳，也没有收到珈罗琳的信。她只得认为她上次从浪搏恩给珈罗琳的那封信，一定是在路上失落了。
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt.	四个星期过去了，吉英还没有见到彬格莱先生的影子。她竭力宽慰自己说，她并没有因此而觉得难受;可是彬格莱小姐的冷淡无情，她到底看明白了。她每天上午都在家里等彬格莱小姐，一直白等了两个星期，每天晚上都替彬格莱小姐编造一个借口，最后那位贵客才算上门来了，可是只待了片刻工夫便告辞而去，而且她的态度也前后判若两人，吉英觉得再不能自己骗自己了。她把这一次的情形写了封信告诉她妹妹，从这封信里可以看出她当时的心情。
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it, I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy: your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.	我最最亲爱的丽萃妹妹：现在我不得不承认，彬格莱小姐对我的关注完全是骗我的。我相信你的见解比我高明，而且你看到我伤心，还会引为得意。亲爱的妹妹，虽然如今事实已经证明你的看法是对的，可是，我如果从她过去的态度来看，我依旧认为，我对她的信任以及你对她的怀疑，同样都是合情合理，请你不要以为我固执。我到现在还不明白她从前为什么要跟我要好;如果再有同样的情况发生，我相信我还会受到欺骗。珈罗琳一直到昨天才来看我，她未来以前不曾给我片纸只字的讯息，既来之后又显出十分不乐意的样子。她只是照例敷衍了我一句，说是没有早日来看我，很是抱歉，此外根本就没有提起她想要再见见我的话。她在种种方面都前后判若两人，因此，当她临走的时候，我就下定决心和她断绝来往，虽说我禁不住要怪她，可是我又可怜她。只怪她当初不该对我另眼看待;我可以问心无愧地说，我和她交情都是由她主动一步一步进展起来的。可是我可怜她，因为她一定会感觉到自己做错了，我断定她所以采取这种态度，完全是由于为她哥哥担心的缘故。我用不着为自己再解释下去了。虽然我们知道这种担心完全不必要，不过，倘若她当真这样担心，那就足以说明她为什么要这样对待我了。既然他确实值得他妹妹珍惜，那么，不管她替他担的是什么忧，那也是合情合理，亲切可喜。不过，我简直不懂她现在还要有什么顾虑，要是他当真有心于我，我们早就会见面了。听她口气，我肯定他是知道我在伦敦的;然而从她谈话的态度看来，就好象她拿稳他是真的倾心于达西小姐似的。这真使我弄不明白。要是我大胆地下一句刻薄的断语，我真忍不住要说，其中一定大有蹊跷。可是我一定会竭力打消一切苦痛的念头，只去想一些能使我高兴的事───譬如想想你的亲切以及亲爱的舅父母对我始终如一的关切。希望很快就收到你的信。彬格莱小姐说起他再也不会回到尼日斐花园来，说他打算放弃那幢房子，可是说得并不怎么肯定。我们最好不必再提起这件事。你从汉斯福我们那些朋友那儿听到了许多令人愉快的事，这使我很高兴。请你跟威廉爵士和玛丽亚一块儿去看看他们吧。我相信你在那里一定会过得很舒适的。
Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.	大约就在这时候，嘉丁纳太太把上次伊丽莎白答应过怎样对待韦翰的事，又向伊丽莎白提醒了一下，并且问起最近的情况如何;伊丽莎白回信上所说的话，虽然自己颇不满意，可是舅母听了却很满意。原来他对她显著的好感已经消失，他对她的殷勤也已经过去──他爱上了别人了。伊丽莎白很留心地看出了这一切，可是她虽然看出了这一切，在信上也写到这一切，却并没有感到什么痛苦，她只不过稍许有些感触。她想，如果她有些财产，早就成为他唯一的意中人了──想到这里，她的虚荣心也就得到了满足。拿他现在所倾倒的那位姑娘来说，她的最显著的魅力就是使他可以获得一万金镑的意外巨款;可是伊丽莎白对自己这件事，也许不如上次对夏绿蒂的事那么看得清楚，因此并没有因为他追求物质享受而怨怪他。她反而以为这是再自然不过的事;她也想象到他遗弃她一定颇费踌躇，可又觉得这对于双方都是一种既聪明而又理想的办法，并且诚心诚意地祝他幸福。
I don't know what I should talk about—about death or about love? Or are they the same? Which one should I talk about?	我不知道该说什么，关于死亡还是爱情？也许两者是一样的？我该讲哪一种？
We were newlyweds. We still walked around holding hands, even if we were just going to the store. I would say to him, "I love you." But I didn't know then how much. I had no idea... We lived in the dormitory of the fire station where he worked. On the second floor. There were three other young couples, we all shared a kitchen. On the first floor they kept the trucks. The red fire trucks. That was his job. I always knew what was happening—where he was, how he was.	我们才刚结婚，连到商店买东西都还会牵手。我告诉他：“我爱你。”但当时我不知道自己有多爱他，我不知道……我们住在消防局的二楼宿舍，和三对年轻夫妇共享一间厨房，红色的消防车就停在一楼。那是他的工作，我向来知道他发生了什么事——他人在哪里，他好不好。
One night I heard a noise. I looked out the window. He saw me. "Close the window and go back to sleep. There's a fire at the reactor. I'll be back soon."	那天晚上我听到声响，探头望向窗外。他看到我就说：“把窗户关上，回去睡觉。反应炉失火了，我马上回来。”
I didn't see the explosion itself. Just the flames. Everything was radiant. The whole sky. A tall flame. And smoke. The heat was awful. And he's still not back.	我没有亲眼看到爆炸，只看到火焰。所有东西都在发亮。火光冲天，烟雾弥漫，热气逼人。他一直没回来。
The smoke was from the burning bitumen, which had covered the roof. He said later it was like walking on tar. They tried to beat down the flames. They kicked at the burning graphite with their feet...They weren't wearing their canvas gear. They went off just as they were, in their shirt sleeves. No one told them. They had been called for a fire, that was it.	屋顶的沥青燃烧，产生烟雾。他后来说，感觉很像走在焦油上。他们奋力灭火，用脚踢燃烧的石墨……他们没有穿帆布制服，只穿着衬衫出勤，没人告诉他们，他们只知道要去灭火。
Four o'clock. Five. Six. At six we were supposed to go to his parents' house. To plant potatoes. It's forty kilometers from Pripyat to Sperizhye, where his parents live. Sowing, plowing—he loved to do that. His mother always told me how they didn't want him to move to the city, they'd even built a new house for him. He was drafted into the army. He served in the fire brigade in Moscow and when he came out, he wanted to be a fireman. And nothing else! [Silence.]	四点钟了。五点。六点。我们本来六点要去他爸妈家种马铃薯，普利彼特离他爸妈住的史毕怀塞大约四十公里。他很喜欢播种、犁地。他妈妈常说，他们多不希望他搬到城里。他们甚至帮他盖了一栋房子。他入伍时被编入莫斯科消防队，退伍后就一心想当消防员！（沉默）
Sometimes it's as though I hear his voice. Alive. Even photographs don't have the same effect on me as that voice. But he never calls to me...not even in my dreams. I'm the one who calls to him.	有时我仿佛听到他的声音在我耳边回响，即使相片对我的影响力都比不上那个声音。但他从来没有呼唤我……连在梦里都没有，都是我呼唤他。
Seven o'clock. At seven I was told he was in the hospital. I ran there, but the police had already encircled it, and they weren't letting anyone through. Only ambulances. 	到了七点，有人告诉我他被送到医院了。我连忙赶去，但警察已经包围了医院，除了救护车，任何人都进不去。
I wasn't the only one there, all the wives whose husbands were at the reactor that night had come. 	不只我在那里，所有当晚丈夫去过反应炉的女人都来了。
I started looking for a friend, she was a doctor at that hospital. I grabbed her white coat when she came out of an ambulance. "Get me inside!" 	我四处寻找在那所医院当医生的朋友，一看到她走下救护车，我就抓住她的白袍说：“把我弄进去！”
"All right," she said. "Come with me. Just for fifteen or twenty minutes."	“好吧，”她说，“跟我来，只能待十五到二十分钟。”
"He needs milk. Lots of milk," my friend said. "They should drink at least three liters each." 	“他需要喝牛奶，很多牛奶，”我的朋友说，“每个人至少要喝三升。”
Many of the doctors and nurses in that hospital, and especially the orderlies, would get sick themselves and die. But we didn't know that then.	那所医院的很多医生和护士，特别是勤务工，后来都生病死了，但是当时我们不知道危险。
I can't wait to get my hands on all of these books! From the soul-soothing words of Brene Brown to the historical observations of Margo Jefferson, there's something here for everyone.	这些书我全都迫不及待想一睹为快。从布琳·布朗安抚心灵的文字，到马戈·杰弗逊的历史观察，每个人都有合适的读物。
AFTER a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.	谈情说爱，筹划好事，就这样度过了一星期，终于到了星期六，柯林斯先生不得不和心爱的夏绿蒂告别。不过，他既已作好接新娘的准备，离别的愁苦也就因此减轻了，他只等下次再来哈福郡，订出佳期，使他成为天下最幸福的男子。他象上次一样隆重其事地告别了浪搏恩的亲戚们，祝贺姐妹们健康幸福，又答应给他们的父亲再来一封谢函。
On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.	下星期一，班纳特太太的弟弟和弟妇照例到浪搏恩来过圣诞节，班纳特太太很是欣喜。嘉丁纳先生是个通情达理、颇有绅士风度的人物，无论在个性方面，在所受的教育方面，都高出他姐姐很多。他原是出身商界，见闻不出货房堆栈之外，竟会这般有教养，这般讨人喜爱，要是叫尼日斐花园的太太小姐们看见了，实在难以相信。嘉丁纳太太比班纳特太太以及腓力普太太，都要小好几岁年纪，也是个和蔼聪慧、而又很文雅的女人，浪搏恩的外甥女儿跟她特别亲切。她们常常进城去在她那儿待一阵子。
The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.	嘉丁纳太太刚到这里，第一件事就是分发礼物，讲述最时新的服装式样。这件事做过以后，她便坐在一旁，静听班纳特太太跟她说话。班纳特太太有多少牢骚要发，又有多少苦要诉。自从上年她弟妇走了以后，她家里受了人家欺负。两个女儿本来快要出嫁了，到头来只落得一场空。
"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley, if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."	“我并不怪吉英，”她接下去说，“因为吉英要是能够嫁给彬格莱先生，她早就嫁了。可是丽萃──唉，弟妇呀!要不是她自己那么拗性子，说不定她已做了柯林斯先生的夫人了。他就在这间房子里向她求婚的，她却把他拒绝了。结果倒让卢卡斯太太有个女儿比我的女儿先嫁出去，浪搏恩的财产从此就得让人家来继承。的确，卢卡斯一家手腕才高明呢，弟妇。他们都是为了要捞进这一笔财产。我本来也不忍心就这样编派他们，不过事实的确如此。我在家里既然过得这样不称心，又偏偏碰到这些只顾自己不顾别人的邻舍，真弄得我神经也坏了，人也病了。你可来得正是时候，给了我极大的安慰，我非常喜欢听你讲的那些长袖子的事情。”
Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation.	嘉丁纳太太远在跟吉英以及伊丽莎白通信的时候，大体上就已经知道了她们家里最近发生的这些事情，又为了体贴外甥女儿们起见，只稍微敷衍了班纳特太太几句，便把这个话题岔开了。
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. "It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she. "I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."	后来伊丽莎白跟她两人在一起的时候，又谈到了这件事。她说：“这倒也许是吉英的一门美满亲事，只可惜吹了。可是这种情形往往是难免！象你所说的彬格莱先生这样的青年，往往不消几个星期的工夫，就会爱上一位美丽的姑娘，等到有一件偶然的事故把他们分开了，他也就很容易把她忘了，这种见异思迁的事情多的是。”
"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not do for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before."	“你这样的安慰完全是出于一片好心，”伊丽莎白说。“可惜安慰不了我们。我们吃亏并不是吃在偶然的事情上面。一个独立自主的青年，几天以前刚刚跟一位姑娘打得火热，现在遭到了他自己朋友们的干涉，就把她丢了，这事情倒不多见。”
"But that expression of "violently in love" is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley's love?"	“不过，所谓‘打得火热’这种话未免太陈腐，太笼统，太不切合实际，我简直抓不住一点儿概念。这种话通常总是用来形容男女一见钟情的场面，也用来形容一种真正的热烈感情。请问，彬格莱先生的爱情火热到什么程度?”
"I never saw a more promising inclination. He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"	“我从来没有看见过象他那样的一往情深；他越来越不去理会别人，把整个的心都放在她身上。他们俩每见一次面，事情就愈显得明朗，愈显得露骨。在他自己所开的一次跳舞会上，他得罪了两三位年轻的小姐，没有邀请她们跳舞；我找他说过两次话，他也没有理我。这还不能算是尽心尽意吗？宁可为了一个人而得罪大家，这难道不是恋爱场上最可贵的地方？”
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.	伊丽莎白非常赞成这个建议，而且相信姐姐也会赞成。
"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her."	“我希望”，嘉丁纳太太又说：“她不要因为怕见到这位青年小伙子而拿不定主意。我们虽然和彬格莱先生同住在一个城里，可不住在同一个地区，来往的亲友也不一样，而且，你知道得很清楚，我们很少外出，因此，除非他上门来看她，他们俩就不大可能见到面。”
"And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London -- ! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him."	“那是绝对不可能的，因为他现在被朋友们软禁着，达西先生也不能容忍他到伦敦的这样一个地区去看吉英！亲爱的舅母，你怎么会想到这上面去了？达西先生也许听到过天恩寺街这样一个地方，可是，如果他当真到那儿去一次，他会觉得花上一个月的工夫也洗不净他身上所染来的污垢;请你放心好了，他绝不会让彬格莱先生单独行动。”
"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with the sister? She will not be able to help calling."	“那就更好。我希望他们俩再也不要见面。可是吉英不还在跟他妹妹通信吗？彬格莱小姐也许难免要来拜望呢。”
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions.	伊丽莎白虽然嘴上说得这么果断，认为彬格莱先生一定被他的姐妹朋友挟住了，不会让他见到吉英，这事情实在可笑，可是她心里想来想去，还是觉得事情未必已经完全绝望。她有时候甚至认为彬格莱先生非常可能对吉英旧情重燃，他朋友们的影响也许敌不过吉英的感情所加给他身上的天然影响。
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.	班纳特小姐乐意地接受了舅母的邀请，她心里并没有怎么想到彬格莱一家人，只希望珈罗琳不和他哥哥同住一宅，那么她就可以偶而到珈罗琳那儿去玩上一个上午，而不至于撞见他哥哥。
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.	嘉丁纳夫妇在浪搏恩待了一个星期，没有哪一天不赴宴会，有时候在腓力普府上，有时候在卢卡斯府上，有时候又在军官那儿。班纳特太太小心周到地为她的弟弟和弟妇安排得十分热闹，以致他们夫妇不曾在她家里吃过一顿便饭。家里有宴会的日子，必定就有几位军官到场，每次总是少不了韦翰。在这种场合下，伊丽莎白总是热烈地赞扬韦翰先生，使利嘉丁纳太太起了疑心，仔细注意起他们两人来，从她亲眼看到的情形来说，她并不以为他们俩真正地爱上了，不过相互之间显然已经发生了好感，这叫她很是不安，她决定在离开哈福郡以前，要把这件事和伊丽莎白谈个明白，并且要解释给她听，让这样的关系发展下去，实在太莽撞。
Mrs. Gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well. Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.	嘉丁纳太太曾经亲眼看到过彭伯里，对于老达西先生也是久闻大名，光是这件事，就是个谈不完的话题。她把韦翰先生所详尽描写的彭伯里和她自己记忆中的彭伯里比较了一下，又把彭伯里主人的德行称赞了一番，谈的人和听的人都各得其乐。她听到他谈起现在这位达西先生对他的亏待，便竭力去回想那位先生小时候的个性如何，是否和现在相符，她终于有自信地记起了从前确实听人说过，费茨威廉·达西先生是个脾气很坏又很高傲的孩子。

Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.	希望破灭了，彻底破灭了。吉英继续把信读下去，只觉得除了写信人那种装腔作势的亲切之外，就根本找不出可以自慰的地方。满篇都是赞美达西小姐的话，絮絮叨叨地谈到她的千娇百媚。珈罗琳又高高兴兴地说，她们俩之间已经一天比一天来得亲热，而且竟大胆地作出预言，说是她上封信里面提到的那些愿望，一定可以实现。她还得意非凡地写道，她哥哥已经住到达西先生家里去，又欢天喜地地提到达西打算添置新家具。
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others. To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as, she thought, he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.	吉英立刻把这些事大都告诉了伊丽莎白，伊丽莎白听了，怒而不言。她真伤心透了，一方面是关怀自己的姐姐，另方面是怨恨那帮人。珈罗琳信上说她哥哥钟情于达西小姐，伊丽莎白无论如何也不相信。她仍旧象以往一样，相信彬格莱先生真正喜欢吉英。伊丽莎白一向很看重他，现在才知道他原来是这样一个容易说话而没有主意的人，以致被他那批诡计多端的朋友们牵制住了，听凭他们反复无常地作弄他，拿他的幸福作牺牲品──想到这些，她就不能不气愤，甚至不免有些看不起他。要是只有他个人的幸福遭到牺牲，那他爱怎么胡搞都可以，可是这里面毕竟还牵涉着她姐姐的幸福，她相信他自己也应该明白。简单说来，这问题当然反复考虑过，到头来一定是没有办法。她想不起什么别的了。究竟是彬格莱先生真的变了心呢，还是根本不知道？虽然对她说来，她应该辨明其中的是非曲直，然后才能断定他是好是坏，可是对她姐姐说来，反正都是一样地伤心难受。
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying,	隔了一两天，吉英才鼓起勇气，把自己的心事说给伊丽莎白听。且说那天班纳特太太象往常一样说起尼日斐花园和它的主人，唠叨了老半天，后来总算走开了，只剩下她们姐妹俩，吉英这才禁不往说道：
"Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before."	“噢，但愿妈妈多控制她自己一些吧！她没晓得她这样时时刻刻提起他，叫我多么痛苦。不过我决不怨谁。这局面不会长久的。他马上就会给我们忘掉，我们还是会和之前一样。”
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.	伊丽莎白半信半疑而又极其关切地望着姐姐，一声不响。
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not that pain. A little time therefore. I shall certainly try to get the better."	“你不相信我的话吗？”吉英微微红着脸嚷道。“那你真是毫无理由。他在我的记忆里可能是个最可爱的朋友，但也不过如此而已。我既没有什么奢望，也没有什么担心，更没有什么要责备他的地方。多谢上帝，我还没有那种苦恼。因此稍微过一些时候，我一定会就慢慢克服过来的。”
With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself."	她立刻又用更坚强的声调说道：“我立刻就可以安慰自己说：这只怪我自己瞎想，好在并没有损害别人，只损害了我自己。”
"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair. You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body. I only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable!"	“别那么说，”伊丽莎白说，“这样说不公平的，你总以为天下都是好人。我只要说了谁一句坏话，你就难受。我要把你看作一个完美无瑕的人，你就来驳斥。请你放心，我决不会说得过分，你有权利把四海之内的人一视同仁，我也不会干涉你。你用不着担心。至于我，我真正喜欢的人没有几个，我心目中的好人就更少了。世事经历得愈多，我就愈对世事不满;我一天比一天相信，人性都是见异思迁，我们不能凭着某人表面上一点点长处或见解，就去相信他。最近我碰到了两件事：其中一件我不愿意说出来，另一件就是夏绿蒂的婚姻问题。这简直是莫明其妙!任你怎样看法，都是莫明其妙！”
"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin."	“亲爱的丽萃，不要这样胡思乱想吧。那会毁了你的幸福的。你对于各人处境的不同和脾气的不同，体谅得不够。你且想一想柯林斯先生的身份地位和夏绿蒂的谨慎稳重吧。你得记住，她也算一个大家闺秀，说起财产方面，倒是一门挺适当的亲事。你且顾全大家的面子，只当她对我们那位表兄确实有几分敬爱和器重吧。”
"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness."	“要是看你的面子，我几乎随便对什么事都愿意以为真，可是这对于任何人都没有益处;我现在只觉得夏绿蒂根本不懂得爱情，要是再叫我去相信她是当真爱上了柯林斯，那我又要觉得她简直毫无见识。亲爱的吉英，柯林斯先生是个自高自大、喜爱炫耀、心胸狭窄的蠢汉，这一点你和我懂得一样清楚，你也会同我一样地感觉到，只有头脑不健全的女人才肯嫁给他。虽说这个女人就是夏绿蒂·卢卡斯，你也不必为她辩护。你千万不能为了某一个人而改变原则，破格迁就，也不要千方百计地说服我，或是说服你自己去相信，自私自利就是谨慎，糊涂胆大就等于幸福有了保障。”
"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned two instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does."	“讲到这两个人，我以为你的话说得太过火，”吉英说。“但愿你日后看到他们俩幸福相处的时候，就会相信我的话不假。这件事可也谈够了，你且谈另外一件吧。你不是举出了两件事吗?我不会误解你，可是，亲爱的丽萃，我求求你千万不要以为错是错在那个人身上，千万不要说你瞧不起他，免得我感到痛苦。我们决不能随随便便就以为人家在有意伤害我们。我们决不可能指望一个生龙活虎的青年会始终小心周到。我们往往会因为我们自己的虚荣心，而给弄迷了心窍。女人们往往会把爱情这种东西幻想得太不切合实际。”
"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."	“如果这桩事当真是存心安排好了的，那实在是他们不应该;可是世界上是否真如某些人所想象的那样，到处都是计谋，我可不知道。”
"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can."	“当然───应该归于最后一种原因。可是，如果叫我再说下去，说出我对于你所器重的那些人是怎么看法，那也会叫你不高兴的。趁着现在我能够住嘴的时候，且让我住嘴吧。”
"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."	“那么说，你断定是他的姐妹们操纵了他啦。”
"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it."“	我不相信。她们为什么要操纵他?她们只有希望他幸福;要是他果真爱我，别的女人便无从使他幸福。”
"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride."	“你头一个想法就错了。她们除了希望他幸福以外，还有许多别的打算；她们会希望他更有钱有势；她们会希望他跟一个出身高贵、亲朋显赫的阔女人结婚。”
"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."	“毫无问题，她们希望他选中达西小姐，”吉英说：“不过，说到这一点，她们也许是出于一片好心，并不如你所想象的那么恶劣。她们认识她比认识我早得多，难怪她们更喜欢她。可是不管她们自己愿望如何，她们总不至于违背她们兄弟的愿望吧。除非有了什么太看不顺眼的地方，哪个做姐妹的会这样冒味？要是她们相信他爱上了我，她们决不会想要拆散我们；要是他果真爱我，她们要拆散也拆散不成。如果你一定要以为他对我真有感情，那么，她们这样做法，便是既不近人情，又荒谬绝伦，我也就更伤心了。不要用这种想法来使我痛苦吧。我决不会因为一念之差而感到羞耻──即使感到羞耻也极其轻微，倒是一想起他或他的姐妹们无情无义，我真不知道要难受多少倍呢。让我从最好的方面去想吧，从合乎人情事理的方面去想吧。”
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	伊丽莎白无法反对她这种愿望，从此以后，她们就不大提起彬格莱先生的名字。
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. "So, Lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love I find. I congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."	班纳特先生对这件事可就抱着两样的态度。有一天他对伊丽莎白说：“嘿，丽萃，我发觉你的姐姐失恋了。我倒要祝贺她。一个姑娘除了结婚以外，总喜欢不时地尝点儿失恋的滋味。那可以使她们有点儿东西去想想，又可以在朋友们面前露露头角。几时轮到你头上来呢?你也不愿意让吉英超前太久吧。现在你的机会来啦。麦里屯的军官们很多，足够使这个村子里的每一个年轻的姑娘失意。让韦翰做你的对象吧。他是个有趣的家伙，他会用很体面的办法把你遗弃。”
"Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's good fortune."	“多谢您，爸爸，差一些的人也能使我满意了。我们可不能个个都指望上吉英那样的好运气。”
"True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it."	“不错，”班纳特先生说：“不管你交上了哪一种运气，你那位好心的妈妈反正会尽心竭力来成全你的，你只要想到这一点，就会感到安慰了。”
Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter.	浪搏恩府上因为近来出了几件不顺利的事，好些人都闷闷不乐，多亏有韦翰先生跟他们来来往往，把这阵闷气消除了不少。她们常常看到他，对他赞不绝口，又说他坦白爽直。伊丽莎白所听到的那一套话───说什么达西先生有多少地方对他不起，他为达西先生吃了多少苦头───大家都公认了，而且公开加以谈论。每个人一想到自己远在完全不知道这件事情时，早就十分讨厌达西先生，便不禁非常得意。
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes -- but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	只有班纳特小姐以为这件事里面一定有些蹊跷，还不曾为哈福郡的人们弄清楚。她是个性子柔和、稳重公正的人，总是要求人家多多体察实情，以为事情往往可能给弄错，可惜别人全把达西先生看作天下再混账不过的人。

Oh honey don't worry, I'm just reading about how to make a dirty movie...What?! Wouldn't it be more precise to watch how to make a dirty movie? If you don't know how to make a dirty movie, that might tell you something, or a few things. But let's not go there. I guess some people just aren't romantic or errr...that perverted? Whichever you think fits best.	哦亲爱的别担心，我只不过是在读拍黄片指南……啥？！它会不会精确到要你观看怎样拍黄片？如果你不晓得怎样拍黄片，这本书会教你一点儿的，或者不少……不过我们还是别谈得太深入了吧，我想有些人应该没这么浪漫或者……呃……这么变态？你怎么想都行。
I hope that this book was written by an ex-Pope, but it probably wasn't, seeing as how writing about how to be a pope is probably a sin in one way or another. Anyone who is reading about how to be a pope, shouldn't be a pope in the first place. Those who are destined to live in the Vatican generally know what their duties will be as a pope while they are archbishop or something.	我希望这本书是前教皇写的，不过极可能不是。怎样写如何当好一个教皇某种程度很可能视为是一种罪行。读这本书的人肯定压根不会是教皇。而这些注定生活在梵蒂冈的人早在他是主教或其他啥职位的时候一般就都知道作为教皇的职责是什么了。
Now...maybe I'm not religious enough, or maybe I think too much, something, but who in their right mind believes that they can actually live forever? There isn't a cycle to break. Life has a beginning, and an end. Maybe an afterlife, no one is too sure, but a book about how to be immortal? Interesting, to say the least.	现在……我大概没那么虔诚，要么我有点想多了。但是一个头壳没坏掉的人谁会相信自己能永生啊？根本就不存在什么循环去打破。生命有始，亦有终。也许有来世，但没人能确定。可是一本关于如何永生不死的书？至多只能说它有趣。
I'm sure this would be a great book, if dragons really existed. Maybe they live and exist inside of your imagination, but not in mine. Besides, who'd want to keep an animal that can literally open its mouth and blowtorch you to death? I'd gladly pass on that option. If you ever cross paths with a dragon, find this book.	我很确定这会成为一本伟大的书的，如果真的有龙存在的话。它们也许生活在你的想象中，不过不在我的想象中。再说了，谁会想要养一头一张嘴就能一口火喷死你的动物？我反正pass。如果你曾遇见过龙，去找这本书吧。
ELIZABETH was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter, -- to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,	伊丽莎白正跟母亲和姐妹坐在一起，回想刚才所听到的那件事，决定不了是否可以把它告诉大家，就在这时候，威廉·卢卡斯爵士来了。他是受了女儿的拜托，前来班府上宣布她订婚的消息。他一面叙述这件事，一面又大大地恭维了太太小姐们一阵，说是两家能结上亲，他真感到荣幸。班府上的人听了，不仅感到惊异，而且不相信真有这回事。班纳特太太再也顾不得礼貌，竟一口咬定他弄错了。丽迪雅一向又任性又撒野，不由得叫道：
"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? -- Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"	“天哪！威廉爵士，你怎么会说出这番话来？你不知道柯林斯先生要娶丽萃吗？”
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.	遇到这种情形，只有象朝廷大臣那样能够逆来顺受的人，才不会生气，好在威廉爵士颇有素养，竟没有把它当一回事，虽然他要求她们相信他说的是实话，可是他却使出了极大的忍耐功夫，满有礼貌地听着她们无理的谈吐。
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.	伊丽莎白觉得自己有责任帮助他来打开这种僵局，于是挺身而出，证明他说的实话，说是刚刚已经听到夏绿蒂本人谈起过了。为了尽力使母亲和妹妹们不再大惊小怪，她便诚恳地向威廉爵士道喜，吉英马上也替她帮腔，又用种种话来说明这门婚姻是何等幸福，柯林斯先生品格又非常好，汉斯福和伦敦相隔不远往返方便。　　
Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing appease her. -- Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.	班纳特太太在威廉爵士面前，实在气得说不出话;可是他一走，她那一肚子牢骚便马上发泄出来。第一，她坚决不相信这回事；第二，她断定柯林斯先生受了骗；第三，她相信这一对夫妇决不会幸福；第四，这门亲事可能会破裂。不过她却从整个事件上简单地得出了两个结论──一个是：这场笑话全都是伊丽莎白一手造成的；另一个是，她自己受尽了大家的欺负虐待；在那一整天里，她所谈的大都是这两点。随便怎么也安慰不了她，随便怎么也平不了她的气。直到晚上，怨愤依然没有消散。她见到伊丽莎白就骂，一直骂了一个星期之久。她同威廉爵士或卢卡斯太太说起话来，总是粗声粗气，一直过了一个月才好起来；至于夏绿蒂，她竟过了好几个月才宽恕了她。
Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!	对班纳特先生说来，这件事反而使他心情上益发洒脱，据他说，这次所经过的一切，真使他精神上舒服到极点。他说，他本以为夏绿蒂·卢卡斯相当懂事，哪知道她简直跟他太太一样蠢，比起他的女儿来就更要蠢了，他实在觉得高兴!
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.	吉英也承认这门婚姻有些奇怪，可是她嘴上并没说什么，反而诚恳地祝他们俩幸福。虽然伊丽莎白再三剖白给她听，她却始终以为这门婚姻未必一定不会幸福。吉蒂和丽迪雅根本不羡慕卢卡斯小姐，因为柯林斯先生不过是个传教士而已;这件事根本影响不了她们，除非把它当作一件新闻，带到Meryton去传播一下。
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	伊丽莎白和夏绿蒂之间从此竟有了一层隔膜，彼此不便提到这桩事。伊丽莎白断定她们俩再也不会象从前那样推心置腹。她既然在夏绿蒂身上失望，便越发亲切地关注到自己姐姐身上来。她深信姐姐为人正直，作风优雅，她这种看法决不会动摇。她关心姐姐的幸福一天比一天来得迫切，因为彬格莱先生已经走了一个星期，却没有听到一点儿她要回来的消息。
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.	吉英很早就给珈罗琳写了回信，现在正在数着日子，看看还得过多少天才可以又接到她的信。柯林斯先生事先答应写来的那封谢函星期二就收到了，信是写给她们父亲的，信上说了多少感激的话，看他那种过甚其辞的语气，就好象在他们府上叨光了一年似的。他在这方面表示了歉意以后，便用了多少欢天喜地的措辞，告诉他们说，他已经有幸获得他们的芳邻卢卡斯小姐的欢心了，他接着又说，为了要去看看他的心上人，他可以趁便来看看他们，免得辜负他们善意的期望，希望能在两个礼拜以后的星期一到达浪博恩;他又说，珈苔琳夫人衷心地赞成他赶快结婚，并且希望愈早愈好，他相信他那位心上人夏绿蒂决不会反对及早定出佳期，使他成为天下最幸福的人。
Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. -- It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. -- She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued absence.	对班纳特太太说来，柯林斯先生的重返浪博恩，如今并不是什么叫人快意的事了。她反而跟她丈夫一样地大为抱怨。说也奇怪，柯林斯不去卢家庄，却要来到浪搏恩，这真是既不方便，又太麻烦。她现在正当健康失调，因此非常讨厌客人上门，何况这些痴情种子都是很讨厌的人。班纳特太太成天嘀咕着这些事，除非想到彬格莱一直不回来而使她感到更大的痛苦时，她方才住口。
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.	吉英跟伊丽莎白都为这个问题大感不安。一天又一天，听不到一点关于他的消息，只听得麦里屯纷纷传言，说他今冬再也不会上尼日斐花园来了，班纳特太太听得非常生气，总是加以驳斥，说那是诬蔑性的谣言。
Even Elizabeth began to fear -- not that Bingley was indifferent -- but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.	连伊丽莎白也开始恐惧起来了，她并不是怕彬格莱薄情，而是怕他的姐妹们真的绊住了他。尽管她不愿意有这种想法，因为这种想法对于吉英的幸福既有不利，对于吉英心上人的忠贞，也未免是一种侮辱，可是她还是往往禁不住要这样想。他那两位无情无义的姐妹，和那位足以制服他的朋友同心协力，再加上达西小姐的窈窕妩媚，以及伦敦的声色娱乐，纵使他果真对她念念不忘，恐怕也挣脱不了那个圈套。
As for Jane, her anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.	至于吉英，她在这种动荡不安的情况下，自然比伊丽莎白更加感到焦虑，可是她总不愿意把自己的心事暴露出来，所以她和伊丽莎白一直没有提到这件事。偏偏她母亲不能体贴她的苦衷，过不了一个钟头就要提到彬格莱，说是等待他回来实在等待心焦，甚至硬要吉英承认──要是彬格莱果真不回来，那她一定会觉得自己受了薄情的亏待。幸亏吉英临事从容不迫，柔和镇定，好容易才忍受了她这些谗言诽语。
Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	班纳特太太着实可怜。只要一提到那门亲事，她就会不高兴，而且随便她走到那儿，她总会听到人们谈起这件事。她一看到卢卡斯小姐就觉得讨厌。一想到卢卡斯小姐将来有一天会接替她做这幢屋子里的主妇，她就益发嫉妒和厌恶。每逢夏绿蒂来看她们，她总以为人家是来考察情况，看看还要过多少时候就可以搬进来住;每逢夏绿蒂跟柯林斯先生低声说话的时候，她就以为他们是在谈论浪搏恩的家产，是在计议一俟班纳特先生去世以后，就要把她和她的几个女儿撵出去。她把这些伤心事都说给她丈夫听。
"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor."	“我的好太太，别去想这些伤心事吧。我们不妨从好的方面去想。说不定我比你的寿命还要长，我们姑且就这样来安慰自己吧。”
This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before, "I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate, If it was not for the entail I should not mind it."	可是这些话安慰不了班纳特太太，因此她非但没有回答，反而象刚才一样地诉苦下去。“我一想到所有的产业都得落到他们手里，就受不了。要不是为了继承权的问题，我才不在乎呢。”
"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility."	“让我们谢天谢地，你头脑还没有不清楚到这种地步。”
If people are buying a book, it must be good, right? Or when it comes to modern ones, they could just have a good marketing campaign, in which case we should reward those who came up with it anyway. Let's have a look on top ten books that made a killing and sort them based on the number of sold copies	人们买书，总是买好的书，对吧？也许会买些仅仅是营销做得好的书，那就当是给想出这主意的人的酬谢吧。下面列出了10本最成功的书，以销量排序。
Although this series has become even more famous after being filmed, it's fair to say that the tale of Middle Earth is an ingenious work of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien. It reaches deep inside of us and plays on our imagination, wishes and inspiration.	尽管魔戒系列在拍成电影后更加有名了，不得不说这个中土传说是托尔金的天才之作。它触及了我们的内心深处，激发了我们的想象，愿望和灵感。
The story of one little hobbit named Frodo Baggins succeeding where immortal elves or noble kings have failed gives us a very truthful message that literally nothing is impossible. Tolkien did a wonderful job in creating a living world and it will take a long time before his legacy is forgotten - if it will ever come to that.	这个故事讲述了一个叫弗罗多巴金斯的霍比特小矮人做到了精灵或者国王都没能做到的事，给我们的启示就是，没有什么是不可能的。托尔金创建的这个精彩的中土世界，人们即使过了很长时间都不会忘了它 - 如果有一天真的会忘的话。
Dream of the Red Chamber is one of the Four Great Classical Novels, as they call them in China. It depicts traditional Chinese cuisine, mythology, proverbs etc. It is based on the author's own experience with the Chinese aristocracy in the 18th century.	红楼梦是中国四大名著之一， 它描述了中国传统的饮食，神话，格言等等。是18世纪作者根据自己在贵族社会的经历而写成的。
And what's going on in this book? Simply put, ten people of different social classes are invited to an island where they are accused of murders and they start dying, one by one - but you'll have to read it yourself, we all know it's a bad idea to talk about plots too much when it comes to detective stories.	这本书到底讲了什么？简单的说，就是10个来自不同阶层的人被邀请到一个岛上，在那里，他们被指控谋杀，开始一个一个的死去 - 你得自己去看，我们都知道讨论过多的情节对侦探小说来说可不是个好主意。
In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.	在短短的一段时间里，柯林斯先生说了多多少少的话，于是两人之间便一切都讲妥了，而且双方都很满意。一走进屋子，他就诚恳地要求她择定吉日，使他成为世界上最幸福的人，虽说这种请求，暂应该置之不理，可是这位小姐并不想要拿他的幸福当儿戏。他天生一副蠢相，求起爱来总是打动不了女人的心，女人一碰到他求爱，总是请他碰壁。卢卡斯小姐所以愿意答应他，完全是为了财产打算，至于那笔财产何年何月可以拿到手，她倒不在乎。
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.	他明天一大早就要启程，来不及向大家辞行，所以当夜太太小姐们就寝的时候，大家便相互话别;班纳特太太极其诚恳、极有礼貌地说，以后他要是有便再来浪博恩，上她们那儿去玩玩，那真叫她们太高兴了。
"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."	他回答道：“亲爱的太太，承蒙邀约，不胜感激，我也正希望能领受这份盛意；请你放心，我一有空就来看你们。”
They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,	大家都吃了一惊，尤其是班纳特先生，根本不希望他马上回来，便连忙说道：
"You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence."	多小心一些只会有益处。什么事都不要紧，可千万不能叫她老人家不高兴。要是你想到我们这儿来，而她却不高兴让你来（我觉得这是非常可能的），那么就请你安分一些，待在家里，你放心，我们决不会因此而见怪的。”
"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."	“老长辈，请相信我，蒙你这样好心地关注，真叫我感激不尽。你放心好了，你马上就会收到我一封谢函，感谢这一点，感谢我在哈福郡蒙你们对我的种种照拂。至于诸位表妹，虽然我去不了多少日子，且请恕我冒昧，就趁着现在祝她们健康幸福，连伊丽莎白表妹也不例外。”
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion.	太太小姐们便行礼如仪，辞别回房;大家听说他竟打算很快就回来，都感到惊讶。班纳特太太满以为他是打算向她的哪一个小女儿求婚，也许能劝劝曼丽去应承他。曼丽比任何姐妹都看重他的能力。他思想方面的坚定很叫她倾心；他虽然比不上她自己那样聪明，可是只要有一个象她这样的人作为榜样，鼓励他读书上进，那他一定会成为一个称心如意的伴侣。只可惜一到第二天早上，这种希望就完全破灭了。卢卡斯小姐刚一吃过早饭，就来访问，私下跟伊丽莎白把前一天的事说了出来。
But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.	只可惜一到第二天早上，这种希望就完全破灭了。卢卡斯小姐刚一吃过早饭，就来访问，私下跟伊丽莎白把前一天的事说了出来。
The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,	早在前一两天，伊丽莎白就一度想到，柯林斯先生可能一厢情愿，自以为爱上了她这位朋友，可是，要说夏绿蒂会怂恿他，那未免太不可能，正如她自己不可能怂恿他一样，因此她现在听到这件事，不禁大为惊讶，连礼貌也不顾了，竟大声叫了起来：
"Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, -- impossible!"	“跟柯林斯先生订婚！亲爱的夏绿蒂，那怎么行！”
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied,	卢卡斯小姐乍听得这一声心直口快的责备，镇静的脸色不禁变得慌张起来，好在这也是她意料中事，因此她立刻就恢复了常态，从容不迫地说：
"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? -- Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"	“你为什么这样惊奇，亲爱的伊丽莎？柯林斯先生不幸没有得到你的赏识，难道就不作兴他得到别的女人的赏识吗？”
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.	伊丽莎白这时候已经镇定下来，便竭力克制着自己，用相当肯定的语气预祝他们俩将来良缘美满，幸福无疆。
"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte, -- "you must be surprised, very much surprised, -- so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."	夏绿蒂回答道：“我明白你的心思，你一定会感到奇怪，而且感到非常奇怪，因为在不久以前，柯林斯先生还在想跟你结婚。可是，只要你空下来把这事情细细地想一下，你就会赞成我的做法。你知道我不是个罗曼谛克的人，我决不是那样的人。我只希望有一个舒舒服服的家。论柯林斯先生的性格、社会关系和身份地位，我觉得跟他结了婚，也能够获得幸福，并不下于一般人结婚时所夸耀的那种幸福。”
Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;" -- and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins, was a most humiliating picture! -- And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.	伊丽莎白心平气和地回答道：“毫无问题。”她们俩别别扭扭地在一起待了一会儿，便和家人一块坐下。夏绿蒂没有过多久就走了;伊丽莎白独自把刚才听到的那些话仔细想了一下。这样不合适的一门亲事，真使她难受了好久。说起柯林斯先生三天之内求了两次婚，本就够稀奇了，如今竟会有人应承他，实在是更稀奇。她一向觉得，夏绿蒂关于婚姻问题方面的见解，跟她颇不一致，却不曾料想到一旦事到临头，她竟会完全不顾高尚的情操，来屈就一些世俗的利益。夏绿蒂做了柯林斯的妻子，这真是天下最丢人的事！她不仅为这样一个朋友的自取其辱、自贬身份而感到难受，而且她还十分痛心地断定，她朋友拈的这一个阄儿，决不会给她自己带来多大的幸福。

THE discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.
	关于柯林斯先生求婚问题的，讨论差不多就要结束了，现在伊丽莎白只感到一种照例难免的的不愉快，有时候还要听她母亲埋怨一两声。说到那位先生本人，他可并不显得意气沮丧，也没有表现出要回避她的样子，只是气愤愤地板着脸，默然无声。他简直不跟她说话，他本来的那一股热情，到下半天都转移到卢卡斯小姐身上去了。卢小姐满有礼貌地听着他说话，这叫大家都松了口气，特别是她的朋友。
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill humour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.
	班纳特太太直到第二天还是同样不高兴，身体也没有复元。柯林斯先生也还是那样又气愤又傲慢的样子。伊丽莎白原以为他这样一气，就会早日离开此地，谁知道他决不因此而改变原来的计划，他讲她要到星期六才走，便决定要待到星期六。
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over. -- To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed.
	吃过早饭，小姐们上麦里屯去打听韦翰先生回来了没有，同时为了他没有参加尼日斐花园的舞会而去向他表示惋惜。她们一走到镇上就遇见了他，于是他陪着小姐们上她们姨妈家里去，他在那儿把他的歉意，他的烦恼，以及他对于每个人的关注，谈了个畅快。不过他却在伊丽莎白面前自动说明，那次舞会是他自己不愿意去参加。
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy; -- that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."
	他说：“当时日期一天天迫近，我心里想，还是不要碰见达西先生的好；我觉得要同他在同一间屋子里，在同一个舞会上，待上好几个钟头，那会叫我受不了，而且可能会闹出些笑话来，弄得彼此都不开心。”
She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.
	她非常赞美他的涵养功夫。当韦翰和另一位军官跟她们一块儿回浪博恩来的时候，一路上他特别照顾她，因此他们有充分的空暇来讨论这个问题，而且还客客气气地彼此恭维了一阵。他所以要伴送她们，是为了两大利益;一来可以让她高兴高兴，二来可以利用这个大好机会，去认识认识她的双亲。
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,
	她们刚回到家里，班纳特小姐就接到一封从尼日斐花园寄来的信。信立刻拆开了，里面装着一张小巧、精致、熨烫得很平滑的信笺，字迹是出自一位小姐的娟秀流利的手笔。伊丽莎白看到姐姐读信时变了脸色，又看到她全神贯注在某几段上面。顷该之间，吉英又镇静了下来，把信放在一旁，象平常一样，高高兴兴地跟大家一起聊天；可是伊丽莎白仍然为这件事焦急，因此对韦翰也分心了。韦翰和他的同伴一走，吉英便对她做了个眼色，叫她跟上楼去。一到了她们自己房里，吉英就拿出信来，说道：
"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says."
	“这是咖罗琳·彬格莱写来的，信上的话真叫我大吃一惊。她们一家人现在已经离开尼日斐花园上城里去了，再也不打算回来了。你看看她怎么说的吧。”
She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words. "I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that." To these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.
	于是她先把第一句念出来，那句话是说，她们已经决定，立刻追随她们的弟兄上城里去，而且要在当天赶到格鲁斯汶纳街吃饭，原来赫斯脱先生就住在那条街上。接下去是这样写的：──“亲爱的朋友，离开哈福德郡，除了你的友谊以外，我真是一无留恋，不过，我希望将来有一天，还是可以象过去那样愉快地来往，并希望目前能经常通信，无话不谈，以抒离悃。临笔不胜企盼。”伊丽莎白对这些浮话奢词，亦只是姑妄听之；虽说她们这一次突然的迁走叫她感到惊奇，可是她并不觉得真有什么可以惋惜的地方。她们离开了尼日斐花园，未必彬格莱先生便不会再在那儿住下去；至于说到跟她们没有了来往，她相信吉英只要跟彬格莱先生时常见面，也就无所谓了。
"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? -- Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them."
	歇了片刻，伊丽莎白说道：“不幸得很，你朋友们临走以前，你没有来得及去看她们一次。可是，彬格莱小姐既然认为将来还有重聚的欢乐，难道我们不能希望这一天比她意料中来得早一些吗？将来做了姑嫂，不是比今天做朋友更满意吗？彬格莱先生不会被她们久留在伦敦的。”
"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you --"
	“咖罗琳肯定地说，她们一家人，今年冬天谁也不会回到哈福郡来了。让我念给你听吧：
"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you."
	‘我哥哥昨天和我们告别的时候，还以为他这次上伦敦去，只要三四天就可以把事情办好；可是我们认为办不到，同时我们相信，查尔斯一进了城，决不肯马上就走，因此我们决计追踪前去，免得他冷冷清清住在旅馆里受罪。我很多朋友都上伦敦去过冬了；亲爱的朋友，我本来还希望听到你进城去的消息，结果我失望了。我真挚地希望你在哈福德郡照常能够极其愉快地度过圣诞节。希望你有很多漂亮的男朋友，免得我们一走，你便会因为少了三个朋友而感到难受。’
"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this winter."
	“这明明是说，”吉英补充道，“他今年冬天不会回来啦。”
"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. -- He is his own master. But you do not know all. I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from you." "Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"
	“你为什么这样想法？那一定是他自己的意思。他自己可以作主。可是你还没有全部知道呢。我一定要把那特别叫我伤心的一段读给你听。我对你完全不必忌讳。‘达西先生急着要去看看他妹妹；说老实话，我们也差不多同样热切地希望和她重逢。我以为乔治安娜·达西无论在容貌方面，举止方面，才艺方面，的确再也没有人能够比得上。露薏莎和我都大胆地希望她以后会做我们的嫂嫂，因此我们对她便越发关切了。我不知道以前有没有跟你提起过我对这件事的感觉，可是当此离开乡村之际，我不愿意不把这些感觉说出来，我相信你不会觉得这是不合理的吧。我的哥哥已经深深地受上了她，他现在可以时常去看她，他们自会更加亲密起来；双方的家庭方面都同样盼望这门亲事能够成功。我想，如果我说，查尔斯最善于博取任何女人的欢心，这可不能是出于做姐妹的偏心，瞎说一阵吧。既是各方面都赞成这段姻缘，而且事情毫无阻碍，那么，最亲爱的吉英，我衷心希望着这件人人乐意的事能够实现，你能说我错吗？’
"What think you of this sentence, my dear Lizzy?" -- said Jane as she finished it. "Is it not clear enough? -- Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"
	你觉得这一句怎么样，亲爱的丽萃？”吉英读完了以后说。“说得还不够清楚吗？这不是明明白白地表明她们不希望、也不愿意我做她们的嫂嫂吗？不是说明了她完全相信他的哥哥对我无所谓吗？而且不也是说明了：假如她怀疑到我对他有感情，她就要劝我（多亏她这样好心肠！）当心些吗？这些话还能有别的解释吗？”
"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. -- Will you hear it?"
	“当然可以有别的解释;我的解释就和你的解释完全两样。你愿意听一听吗？”
"You shall have it in few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."
	“这只消三言两语就可以说明白。彬格莱小姐看出他哥哥爱上了你，可是她却希望他和达西小姐结婚。她跟着他到城里去，就为的是要把他绊住在那儿，而且竭力想来说服你，叫你相信他对你没有好感。”
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. -- No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley I am sure cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this. We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."
	“吉英，你的确应该相信我。凡是看见过你们俩在一起的人，都不会怀疑到他的感情。我相信彬格莱小姐也不会怀疑，她不是那么一个傻瓜。要是她看到达西先生对她的爱有这样的一半，她就要办嫁妆了。可是问题是这样的：在她们家里看来，我们还不够有钱，也不够有势，她所以急于想把达西小姐配给她哥哥，原来还有一个打算，那就是说，亲上加亲以后，亲上再加亲就更省事了。这件事当然很费了一些心机，我敢说，要不是德·包尔小姐从中作梗，事情是会成功的。可是最亲爱的吉英，你千万不要因为彬格莱小姐告诉你说，她哥哥已经深深地爱上了达西小姐，你就以为彬格莱先生自从星期二和你分别以来，对你的倾心有丝毫变卦，也别以为她真有本事叫她哥哥不爱你，而去爱上她那位女朋友。”
"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your representation of all this, might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself."
	“假如我对彬格莱小姐看法是一致的，”吉英回答道，“那么，你的一切想法就会大大地让我安心了。可是我知道你这种说法很偏心。珈罗琳不会故意欺骗任何人，我对这件事只能存一个希望，那就是说，一定是她自己想错了。”
"That is right. -- You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."
	“这话说得对。我的想法既然不能安慰你，你自己居然转得出这样的好念头来，那是再好也没有了，你就相信是她自己想错了吧。现在你算是对她尽了责任，再也用不着烦恼。”
"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"
	“可是，亲爱的妹妹，即使从最好的方面去着想，我能够给这个人的，而他的姐妹和朋友们都希望他跟别人结婚，这样我会幸福吗？”
"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him."
	“那就得看你自己的主张如何，”伊丽莎白说。“如果你考虑成熟以后，认为得罪了他的姐妹们所招来的痛苦，比起做他的太太所得来的幸福还要大，那么，我劝你决计拒绝了他算数。”
"How can you talk so?" -- said Jane faintly smiling, -- "You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate."
	“你怎么说得出这种话？”吉英微微一笑。“你要知道，即使她们的反对使我万分难受，我还是不会犹豫的。”
"I did not think you would; -- and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion."
	“我并没有说你会犹豫；既然如此，我就可以不必再为你担心了。”
"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand things may arise in six months!"
	“倘若他今年冬天不回来，我就用不着左思右想了。六个月里会有多少变动啊。”
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one.
	所谓他不会回来，这种想法伊丽莎白大不以为然。她觉得那不过是咖罗琳一厢情愿。她认为珈罗琳这种愿望无论是露骨地说出来也罢，委婉地说出来也罢，对于一个完全无求于人的青年来说，决不会发生丝毫影响。
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.
	她把自己对这个问题的感想，解释给她姐姐听，果然一下子就收到了很好的效果，她觉得非常高兴。吉英这样的性子，本来不会轻易意志消沉，从此便渐渐产生了希望认为彬格莱先生准定会回到尼日斐花园一，使她万事如意，尽管有时候她还是怀疑多于希望。
They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.
	最后姐妹俩一致主张，这事在班纳特太太面前不宜多说，只要告诉她一声，这一家人家已经离开此地，不必向她说明他走原因；可是班纳特太太光是听到这片段的消息，已经大感不安，甚至还哭了起来，埋怨自己运气太坏，两位贵妇人刚刚跟她处熟就走了。不过伤心了一阵以后，她又用这样的想法来安慰自己；彬格莱先生不久就会回来，到浪博恩来吃饭；最后她心安理得地说，虽然只不过邀他来便饭，她一定要费些心思，请他吃两道大菜。
The princeps had ordered an emergency meeting of all Trisolaran consuls. This was very unusual. Something important must have happened.	元首下令召开三体世界全体执政官紧急会议，这很不寻常，一定有什么重大的事件发生。
Twenty thousand Trisolaran hours ago. the Trisolaran Fleet had launched. The ships knew the approximate directions of their target but not its distance. It was possible tha the target was millions of light-hours away, or even at the other end of the galaxy. Faced with the endless sea of stars, the expedition had little hope.	两万三体时前，三体舰队启航了，它们只知道目标的大致方向，却不知道它的距离。也许，目标处于千万光时之外，甚至在银河系的另一端，面时着前方茫茫的星海，这是一次希望渺茫的远征。
The meeting of consuls occurred under the Pendulum Monument. [As Wang Miao read about this episode, he couldn't help but recall the session at the UN Building in the Three Body game. In reality, the Pendulum Monument was one of the few objects in the game that really did exist on Trisolaris.	执政官会议在巨摆纪念碑下举行。（汪淼在阅读这一段信息时，不由联想到《三体》游戏中的联合国大会，事实上，巨摆纪念碑是游戏中少数在三体世界中真实存在的事物之一。）
The princeps's choice of meeting site confused most of the attendees. The Chaotic Era wasn't over yet, and a small sun had just risen over the horizen, though it could also set at any moment. The temperature was cold, and all the attendees were forced to wear fully enclosed electric-heating suits. The massive metal pendulum swung magnificenlty, pounding the friged air. The small sun cast a long shadow against the ground, as if a giant whose head touched the sky were striding there. Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, the princeps ascended onto the base of the pendulum and flipped a red switch.	元首选定这个会址，令大多数与会者迷惑不解。乱纪元还没有结束，天边刚刚升起了一轮很小的太阳，随时都可能落下，天气异常寒冷，以至于与会者不得不穿上全封闭的电热服。巨大的金属摆气势磅礴地摆动着，冲击着寒冷的空气，天边的小太阳把它的影子长长地投射到大地上，像一个顶天立地的巨人在行走。众目睽睽之下，元首走上巨摆的基座，扳动了一个红色的开关，转身对执政官们说：
He turned to the consuls and said, "I have just shut off power to the pendulum. It will gradually stop under the influence of air resistance."	“我刚刚关闭了巨摆的动力电源，它将在空气阻力下慢慢地停下来。”
"We all understand the historical significance of the pendulum. It's intended to hypnotize God. But now we know it's better for Trisolaran civilization to have God awake, becuase God is now blessing us."	“我们都清楚巨摆的历史涵义，它是用来对上帝进行催眠的。现在我们知道，上帝醒着对三体文明更有利，它开始保佑我们了。”
Everyone was silent, pondering the meaning of the princeps's words. After three more swings from the pendulum, someone asked, "Has the Earth responded?"	众人沉默了，思索着元首这话的含义。在巨摆摆动了三次之后，有人问：“地球文明回电了？”
The princeps nodded. "Yes. Half an hour ago I received the report. It was a response to the warning that was sent."	元首点点头，“是的，半个三体时前我得到的报告，是回答那条警告信息的。”
"So soon! Only eighty thousand hours have passed since then, which means...which means..."	“这么快？！现在距警告信息发出仅八万多时，这就是说，这就是说……”
The attendees grew ecstatic, but they couldn't express the feeling, so the crowd seemed like a pent-up volcano. The princeps knew that allowing such weak emotions to explode would be dangerous. So he poured cold water on their sentiments. "I have already ordered the Trisolaran Fleet to turn toward this star. But things are not quite as optimistic as you think. Given what we know, right now the fleet is sailing toward certain death."	狂喜在会场上蔓延开来，但又不能充分表现，像被压抑的火山。元首知道，让这种脆弱的情绪爆发出来是有害的，于是，他立刻对“火山”泼了盆冷水：“我已经命令三体舰队航向这颗恒星，但事情并不如你们想象的那样乐观，照目前的情况看，舰队是在航向自己的坟墓。”
"I do," said the science consul. "We've all studied the first messages from Earth carefully. The sections most worthy of attention is their history. Let's observe the facts: Humans took more than a hundred thousand Earth years to pregress from the Hunter-Gatherer Age to the Agricultural Age. To get from the Agricultural Age to the Industrili Age took a few thousand Earth years. But to go from the Industril Age to the Atomic Age took only two hundred Earth years. Thereafter, in only a few Earth decades, they entered the Information Age. The civilization possesses the terrifying ability to accelerate their progress.	“我明白。”科学执政官说，“我们都仔细研究过第一批收到的地球信息，其中最值得注意的是他们的文明史。请看以下事实：人类从狩猎时代到农业时代，用了十几万地球年时间；从农业时代到工业时代用了几千地球年；而由工业时代到原子时代，只用了二百地球年；之后，仅用了几十个地球年，他们就进入了信息时代。这个文明，其有可怕的加速进化能力！
"On Trisolaris, of the more than two hundred civilizations, including our own,none has ever experenced such accelerating development. The progress of science and technology in all Trisolaran civilizations has been at a constant or decelerating pace. In our world, each technology age requires approximately the same amount of time for steady, slow development."	而在三体世界，已经存在过的包括我们在内的二百个文明中，没有一个经历过这种加速发展，所有的三体文明的科学和技术的进步都是匀速甚至减速的。我们世界的各个技术时代，都需要基本相同的漫长的发展时间。”
The princeps nodded. "The fact is that four million and five hundred thousand hours from now, when the Trisolaran Fleet has reached the Earth, that civilization's technology level will have long surpassed ours, due to their accelerating development. The journey of the Trisolaran Fleet is long and arduous, and the fleet must pass through two interstellar dust belts. It's very likely that only half of ships wil reach the Earth's solar system, while the rest perish along the way. And then, the Trisolaran Fleet will be at the mercy of a much more powerful Earth civilization. This is not an expdetion, but a funeral procession!"	元首接着说：“现实是，在四百五十万时后，当三体舰队到达地球所在的行星系时，那个文明的技术水平已在加速发展中远超过我们！三体舰队经过那么漫长的航行，中间还要穿越两条星际尘埃带，很可能只有一半的飞船到达太阳系，其余的将损失在漫长的航程中。到那时，三体舰队在地球文明面前将不堪一击——我们不是去远征，是去送死！”
"But if this is true, Princeps, then there are even more frightening consequences..." the ilitary consul said.	“如果真是这样，元首，还有更可怕的……”军事执政官说。
"Yes. It's easy to imagine. The location of Trisolaris has been exposed. To eliminate future threats, an interstellar fleet from Earth will launche a counterattack against us. It's very possible that long before an expanded sun swallows this planet, Trisolaran civilization will have already been extinguished by humans."	“是的，这很容易想到。三体文明的位置已经暴露，为了消除未来的威胁，地球的星际舰队将反攻我们的星系。很可能，在膨胀的太阳把这颗行星吞没之前，三体文明已经被地球人消灭了。”
The bright future had suddenly turned impossibly grim. The attendees fell silent.	光明灿烂的前景突然变得如此黯淡，使会场沉默了好久。
The princeps said, "What we must do next is contain the progress of science on Earth. Luckily, as soon as we received the first messages from Earth, we began to develop plans to do so. As of now, we've discovered a favorable condition fro realizing these plans: The response we just received was sent by an Earth traitor. Thus, we have reason to believe tha there are many alienated forces within Earth civilization, and we must exploit such forces to the fullest."	元首说：“我们下一步要做的，就是遏制地球文明的科学发展。早在收到第一批信息时，我们就开始制定这方面的计划。现在，实现这些计划出现了一个很有利的条件：我们这次收到的回答信息，是由地球文明的一个背叛者发出的，那么我们有理由猜测，地球文明的内部存在着相当多的异己力量，我们要充分利用这种力量。”
"Princeps, that is not at all easy. We have but a thin thread of conmmunication with the Earth. It takes more than eighty thousand hours to complete an exchange."	“元首，谈何容易，我们与地球的联系细若游丝，八万多时才能完成一次应答。”
"But remember that, like us, the knowledge that there are extrterrestrial civilizations will shock all of Earth society and leave profoud marks. We have reason to believe tha the alienated forces within Earth civilization will coalesce and grwo."	“也不尽然，同我们一样，地球世界得知外星文明的存在对整个社会来说是一个巨大的冲击，将对文明内部产生深远影响。我们有理由预测，地球文明内部的异己力量将汇集和增长。”
"Given a time gap of forty thousand hours, the strategic value of any traditional tactics of war or terror is insignificant, and they can recover from them. To effectivley contain a civilization's develpment and disarm it across such a long span of time, there is only one way: kill its science."	“在长达四万时的时间跨度上，任何传统的战争和恐怖活动的战略意义都不大，都可以得到恢复。在这样长的时间跨度上，要想有效遏制一个文明的发展，解除其武装，办法只有一个，杀死它们的科学。
The science consul said, "The plan focused on emphasizing the negative environmental effects of scientific development and showing signs of supernatural power to the population of Earth. In addition to highlighting the negative effects of progress, we'll also attempt to use a series of 'miracles' to constcut an illusory universe that cannot be explained by the logic of science. After these illusions have been maintained for some time, it's possible that Trisolaran civilization may become a target of religious worship there. Then, unscientific ways of thinking will dominate scientific thinking among human intellectuals, and lead to the collapse of the entire scientific system of thought."	“第一个计划代号‘染色’。”科学执政官说，“利用科学和技术产生的副作用，使公众对科学产生恐惧和厌恶，比如我们世界中技术发展导致的环境问题，想必在地球上也存在，染色计划将充分利用这此因素。第二个计划代号‘神迹’。即对地球人进行的超自然力量的展示，这个计划力图通过一系列的‘神迹’，建造一个科学逻辑无法解释的虚假宇宙。当这种假象持续一定时间后，将有可能使三体文明在那个世界成为宗教信徒的崇拜对象，在地球的思想界，非科学的思维方式就会压倒科学思维，进而导致整个科学思想体系的崩溃。”
"The key to miracles is that they cannot be seen as tricks. This may require that we tranfer certain technologies far above current human technology level to the alienated forces on Earth."	“神迹之所以成为神迹，关键在于它是地球人绝对无法识破的。这可能需要我们向地球异己力量输入一些高于他们现有水平的技术。”
"That's too risky! Who knows who will ultimately control such technologies? That's playing with fire."	“这太冒险了，最后谁会得到这些技术？简直是玩火！”
"Of course, which specific technologies should be transferred to produce miracles requires further study..."	“当然，输入什么层次的技术来产生神迹，还有待于我们进一步研究……”
"Pleas hold on for a moment, Science Consul," said the military consul as he stood up. "Princeps, I am of the opinion that this plan will be almost useless in terms of stopping human science."	“请科学执政官停一下！”军事执政官站起来说，“元首，我想表明自己的看法：这两个计划对杀死人类的科学，几乎起不到什么作用。”
"But it's better than nothing," the science consul argued.	“但做总比不做强。”科学执政官抢在元首回答前争辩道。
"I agree with your view," the princeps said. "This plan will only interfere slightly with human scientific development. We need a decisive act that will completely suffocate science on Earth and freeze it at its current level. Let's focus on the key here: Overall technological development depends on the advancement of basic science, and the foundation of basic science lies in the exploration of the deep structure of matter. If there's no progress in this field, there can be no major breakthrough in science and technology as a whole. Of course, this is not specific to civilization on Earth. It is applicable to all targets that Trisolaran civilization intends to conquer. We had begun work in this area even before receiving the first extra-Trisolaran communication. But we've recenlty stepped up the effort. "Now, everyone, look up. What's that?"	“我同意你的看法,‘染色’和‘神迹’两个计划，只能对地球科学发展产生一些干扰。”元首对军事执政官说，然后转向所有与会者，“我们需要一个决定性的行动，彻底窒息地球的科学，使其锁死在现有水平。在这里，我们需要抓住重点：科学技术的全面发展取决于基础科学的发展，而基础科学的基础又在于对物质深层结构的探索，如果这个领域没有进展，科学技术整体上就不可能产生重大突破。其实，这并非只是针对地球文明，也是针对三体文明要征服的所有目标，早在首次收到外星信息之前，我们就在做着这方面的努力，近期的步伐大大加快了。各位请看，那是什么？”
The princeps pointed at the sky. The consuls lifted their heads to gaze in that direction. They saw a ring in space giving off a metallic glow in the sunlight.	元首指指天空，执政官们向那个方向抬头仰望，看到太空中的一个圆环，在阳光中发出金属的光泽。
"Is that the dock for building the second space fleet?"	“那不是用于建造第二支太空舰队的船坞吗？”
"No. That's a large particle accelerator still under construction. The plans for bulding a second space fleet have been scrapped. All resources are now devoted to Project Sophon."	“不是，那是一台正在建造的巨型粒子加速器。建造第二支太空舰队的计划取消了，其资源全部用于智子工程。”
"Yes. We've kept this plan secret from most of you present. I now ask the science consul to give an introduction."	“是的，在场的人至少有一半不知道这个计划，我现在请科学执政官把它介绍给大家。”
"I know about this plan, but didn't know it had progressed so far." The speaker was the industry consul.	“我知道这个计划，但没想到已经进行到这个程度。”工业执政官说。
The culture and education consul said, "I knew about this plan as well, but thought it was like a fairy tale."	文教执政官：“我也知道，但感觉那像个神话。”
The science consul said, "Project Sophon, to put it simply, aims to tranform a proton into a superintelligent computer."	“智子工程，简而言之就是把一个质子改造成一台超级智能计算机。”科学执政官说。
"This is a science fantasy that most of us have heard about," the agricultural consul said. "But can it be realized? I know that physicists can already manipulate nine of the eleven dimensions of the micro-scale world, but we still can't imagine how they could stick a pair a of tiny tweezers into a proton to build large-scale integrated circuits."	“作为一个广为流传的科学幻想，这大家都听说过。”农业执政官说，“但要成为现实，还是太突然了些。我知道，物理学家们已经能够操控微观世界十一维结构中的九维，但我们还是无法想象，他们能把一把小镊子伸进质子，在里面搭建大规模集成电路吗？”
"Of course that's impossible. The etching o fmicro integrated circuits can only occur at the macro scale, and only on a macroscopic two-dimensional plane. Thus, we must unfold a proton into two dimensions."	“当然不行，对微观集成电路的蚀刻，只能在宏观中进行，而且只能在宏观的二维平面上进行。所以，我们需要将一个质子进行二维展开。”
"Very big, as you will see." The science consul smiled.	“很大，您会看到的。”科学执政官微笑着说。
Another sixty thousand Trisolaran hours went by. Twenty thousand Trisolaran hours after the completion of the huge particle accelerator in sapce, the unfolding of the proton into two dimensions was about to begin in a synchronous orbit around Trisolaris.	时光飞逝，六万个三体时又过去了。在太空中的巨型加速器完全建成后的两万个三体时，对质子的二维展开将要在三体行星的同步轨道上进行。
It was a beautiful and mild Stable Era day. The sky was particularly clear. Like the day when the fleet had set sail eighty thousand Trisolaran hours ago, the entire population of Trisolaris looked up into the sky, gazing at that giant ring. The princeps and all the consuls again came and stood under the Pendulum Monument. The Pendulum had long stopped, and the weight hung still like a solid rock between the tall pillars. Looking at it, it was hard to believe that it onece moved.	这是一个恒纪元风和日丽的日子，天空十分纯净。同八万个三体时前舰队启航的时候一样，三体世界的人们都在仰望着太空，看着那巨大的圆环。元首和全体执政官再次来到了巨摆纪念碑下，巨摆早已静止，摆锤如一块稳定的磐石凝固在高大的支架间，看上去很难相信它曾经运动过。
The science sonsul gave the order to unfold into two dimensions. In space, three cubes drifted around the ring-the fusion generators that powered the accelerator. Their winglike heat sinks gradually began to glow with a dim reddish light. The crowd anxiously stared at the accelerator, but nothing seemed to happen.	科学执政官发出了二维展开的启动命令。太空中，圆环周围有三个立方体，那是为加速器提供能量的聚变发电站，现在，它们那形状像长翅的散热片渐渐发出暗红色的光。科学执政官向元首报告展开正在进行，人们紧张地仰望着太空中的加速器，什么都没有发生。

Most notable on the list may be Between The World and Me, whose author often writes critically of the way Obama addresses issues of race, especially those tied to recent cases of police brutality. 	这其中最值得注意的是《在世界与我之间》，其作者经常撰文批评奥巴马解决种族问题的方式，特别是最近发生的警察暴力执法的案件。

This is what happens to Don Quixote, who attempts many chivalrous knightly acts while hampered by a world that has rejected knightly virtues. 	唐吉坷德就是这么一个人。他彬彬有礼、处处发扬骑士的美德善行，却不为周遭世界接受。
The Guardian placed this 400-year-old classic novel among the its all-time Top 100 books. 《	卫报》曾评选出100本经典书目，这部享誉400年的经典巨著也在其中。
Cervantes weaves all three elements – madness, comedy, and fantasy – in between conversations and adventures shared between Quixote and Sancho Panza, his seemingly simple-minded but loyal and outspoken aide de camp. 	在塞万提斯笔下，癫狂、喜剧和梦幻这三种元素交织在一起，融汇于唐吉坷德和桑乔·潘扎烈俩人的对话和历险中。桑丘·潘沙是堂吉诃德的侍从，他看似头脑简单，却很忠诚，而且直言不讳。
Exploring the link between science and human nature, or a scientifically applied moral philosophy, is the goal of this Treatise. 	这本书主要探索科学和人性的关系，或者说是道德哲学的科学应用。

By banishing supernatural doctrine that looks beyond the existing world, fear and prejudice can take a backseat in human experience. 	书中摒弃了洞察世事的超自然教条，恐惧和偏见占据人类体验的次要地位。
Einstein's favourite reading during his last few months of his life were humorist stories of B.Knovner, a writer for the Jewish Daily Forward. 	爱因斯坦临终前最后几个月最爱读的是《犹太日报》幽默大师布鲁斯·柯夫纳的小说。

“Isis Unveiled: Secrets of the Ancient Wisdom Tradition” by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky 《	揭开伊西斯的面纱》，海伦娜·彼罗夫娜·布拉瓦茨基
As a theosophist, Blavatsky promoted pantheism and greatly influenced both Mahatma Gandhi and Annie Besant. 	作为神智学者，布拉瓦茨基宣扬泛神论，对甘地和安妮·贝费特有很大影响。
In this work, spiritualism and occult practices are the base for examining ancient Eastern and Western wisdom, rather than the traditionally reversed path of finding knowledge. 	这本著作中，唯心论和神秘学是检验古代中西智慧的基础，而不是传统意义上与之相反的求知道路。
Blavatsky examines existing philosophical systems and ideas and finds them to be inadquate. 	布拉瓦茨基认为现行的哲学体系和思想存有不足。
This is of the best allegorical novels to explain the fractured nature of 19th century Russia. Each character is representative of one of the ruling classes. 	这是最棒的讽喻小说之一，阐释了19世纪俄国社会的阶级对立。每一个人物都代表了统治阶级的一员。
There is the father Fyodor, the landowner who is negligent about his land, but greedy in using its produce for himself. There's Dmitri, who has been passed around from house to house. There's the skeptic Ivan, who wishes to live more among cold concepts than people. And gentle Alyosha, the mystic and religious peacemaker, and the illegitimate Smerdyakov. 	父亲费奥多是地主，疏于农作却挂念着农产品。还有德米特里，在各家各户辗转。另有疑神疑鬼的伊万，与其和人相处，更愿意活在冰冷的概念里。还有温柔的阿辽沙，既神秘又信奉宗教的和事佬，及私生的斯梅迪亚克。
Throughout are themes of love, law, and duty, which makes this one of the best Dostoyesky books to read besides Crime and Punishment. 	贯穿整个小说的主题是爱、法律和责任，这使其成为杜斯妥也夫斯基《罪与罚》之外最值得一读的书。
MR. COLLINS was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had stedfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.
	柯林斯先生独自一个人默默地幻想着美满的姻缘，可是并没有想上多久，因为班纳特太太一直待在走廊里混时间，等着听他们俩商谈的结果，现在看见伊丽莎白开了门，匆匆忙忙走上楼去，她便马上走进饭厅，热烈地祝贺柯林斯先生，祝贺她自己，说是他们今后大有亲上加亲的希望了。柯林斯先生同样快乐地接受了她的祝贺，同时又祝贺了她一番，接着就把他跟伊丽莎白刚才的那场谈话，一五一十地讲了出来，说他有充分的理由相信，谈话的结果很令人满意，因为他的表妹虽然再三拒绝，可是那种拒绝，自然是她那羞怯淑静和娇柔细致的天性的流露。
This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; -- she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.
	这一消息可叫班纳特太太吓了一跳。当然，要是她的女儿果真是口头上拒绝他的求婚，骨子里却在鼓励他，那她也会同样觉得高兴的，可是她不敢这么想，而且不得不照直说了出来。
"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will make her know it."
	她说：“柯林斯先生，你放心吧，我会叫丽萃懂事一些的。我马上就要亲自跟她谈谈。她是个固执的傻姑娘，不明白好歹；可是我会叫她明白的。”
"pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."
	“对不起，让我插句嘴，太太，”柯林斯先生叫道：“要是她果真又固执又傻，那我就不知道她是否配做我理想的妻子了，因为象我这样地位的人，结婚自然是为了要幸福。这么说，如果她真拒绝我的求婚，那倒是不要勉强她好，否则，她脾气方面有了这些缺点，她对于我的幸福决不会不什么好处。”
"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. "Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."
	班纳特太太吃惊地说：“先生，你完全误会了我的意思，丽萃不过在这类事情上固执些，可是遇到别的事情，她的性子再好也没有了。我马上去找班纳特先生，我们一下子就会把她这个问题谈妥的，我有把握。”
She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library,
	她不等他回答，便急忙跑到丈夫那儿去，一走进他的书房就嚷道：
"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her."
	“噢，我的好老爷，你得马上出来一下；我们闹得天翻地覆了呢。你得来劝劝丽萃跟柯林斯先生结婚，因为她赌咒发誓不要他；假如你不赶快来打个圆场，他就要改变主意，反过来不要她了。”
Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.
	班纳特先生见她走进来，便从书本上抬起眼睛，安然自得、漠不关心地望着她脸上。他听了她的话，完全不动声色。
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech. "Of what are you talking?"
	她说完以后，他便说道：“抱歉，我没有听懂你究竟说些什么。”
"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."
	“我说的是柯林斯先生和丽萃的事，丽萃表示不要柯林斯先生，柯林斯先生也开始说他不要丽萃了。”
"And what am I to do on the occasion? -- It seems an hopeless business."
	“这种事叫我有什么办法？看来是件没有指望的事。”
"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him."
	“你去同丽萃说说看吧。就跟她说，你非要她跟他结婚不可。”
Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.
	班纳特太太拉下了铃，伊丽莎白小姐给叫到书房里来了。
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared. "I have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was. "Very well -- and this offer of marriage you have refused?"
	爸爸一见她来，便大声说：“上这儿来，孩子，我叫你来谈一件要紧的事。我听说柯林斯先生向你求婚，真有这回事吗？”伊丽莎白说，真有这回事。“很好。你把这桩婚事回绝了吗？”
"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is not it so, Mrs. Bennet?"
	“很好，我们现在就来谈到本题。你的妈非要你答应不可。我的好太太，可不是吗？”
"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. -- Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do."
	“摆在你面前的是个很不幸的难题，你得自己去抉择，伊丽莎白。从今天起，你不和父亲成为陌路人，就要和母亲成为陌路人。要是你不嫁给柯林斯先生，你的妈就不要再见你，要是你嫁给他，我就不要再见你了。”
1. Junot Díaz, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (2007)
 	朱诺·迪亚斯，《奥斯卡·瓦奥短暂而奇妙的一生》（2007年）
The winner in this BBC Culture critics' poll is Junot Diaz's first novel, about New Jersey ghetto-nerd Oscar, who dreams of being the Dominican-American Tolkien and finding love. It also was named as the number-one book by the most critics. "It is a big deal for me to fall in love with a book when its DNA is science fiction, fantasy and testosterone," says Elizabeth Taylor, The Chicago Tribune's literary editor-at-large. "This was only the second book by a Latino author to receive the Pulitzer Prize in fiction," notes critic and author Rigoberto Gonzalez. "Oscar Wao reaffirmed the strong connections Latinos maintain with their ancestral homeland's culture, language and history. It also re-energised these questions: Who is American? What is the American experience?" (Riverhead)
	这次BBC文化栏目评选的最佳小说是朱诺·迪亚斯的处女作，该书主人公名叫奥斯卡，他是来自新泽西贫民窟的多米尼加裔美国宅男，他渴望与异性接触，并梦想着成为美国的托尔金。大多数评论员将其列为书单中的第一名。《芝加哥论坛报》的文学特约编辑伊丽莎白·泰勒评价道：“我从未想过，我会如此钟爱一本充满白日梦和男性荷尔蒙的科幻小说。”评论家、作家里戈伯特·冈萨雷斯表示：“迪亚斯是第二位荣获普利策奖的拉丁裔小说作家。”评论家、剧作家格雷格·巴里奥斯同样盛赞：“奥斯卡·瓦奥重新确认了拉丁美洲人与家乡的文化、语言和历史之间根深蒂固的联系。这也让我们重新思考：什么样的人才是美国人？美国印象到底是什么？”（Riverhead出版社）
2. Edward P Jones, The Known World (2003)
 	爱德华·P·琼斯，《已知的世界》（2003年）
Set in 1855 on the plantation of Henry Townsend – born a slave, now a slave-owner – The Known World is a triumph of empathy, immersing readers in a complex moral time without making simple judgments. Facing an early death, Townsend ponders the future of his 50-acre Virginia plantation and the slaves he treats the way his former owner, now his mentor, taught him. "In my reading, The Known World is the best American novel published in the 21st Century – a stunning work about humans experiencing and surviving American slavery," notes critic Walton Muyumba, author of The Shadow and the Act. C Max Magee, founder and editor of The Millions writes, "Jones's novel has an epic, complex sweep and takes an unflinching and engrossing view of America's messy history." (Amistad)
	故事发生在1855年的一个种植园，主人公亨利·汤森德生为奴隶，现为奴隶主。此书是激起共情的典范之作，面对复杂的道德情感，读者感同身受，不会妄下定论。汤森德拥有弗尼吉亚州50英亩种植园和一些奴隶，他对待奴隶的方式与自己曾经的奴隶主如出一辙。面对早逝的命运，对于将来如何处置他的财产，汤森德总是诸多考量。《阴影和艺术》的作者沃尔顿·穆永巴评价说：“在我读过的书中，《已知的世界》是21世纪出版的最优秀的美国小说——关于人生阅历和美国奴隶生存的惊人之作。”电子杂志《百万》的创始人兼编辑C·马克斯·麦基写道：“《已知的世界》以史诗般的宏大视角，直面美国那段不堪回首的历史，引人入胜。”（Amistad出版社）
Mantel's boldly reimagined saga of 16th Century Europe, told from the perspective of Thomas Cromwell, won the Man Booker and National Book Critics Circle awards, was adapted to the stage and has been filmed as a new BBC miniseries. "The brilliance of retelling an oft-told tale is beautifully illustrated in Mantel's flawless examination of power through the rise of Thomas Cromwell," notes critic Karen R Long. Mary Ann Gwinn, Seattle Times book editor and co-host of Well Read TV, writes: "I have never felt so completely catapulted into a character's mind, not to mention a long ago and far away place." Mantel's sequel, Bring in the Bodies, also gathered votes. (Picador)
	本书从托马斯·克伦威尔的视角，大胆畅想，再现了16世纪欧洲传奇，赢得了布克奖和美国国家图书评论界奖，后来被改编成舞台剧，还被BBC改编成了迷你剧。评论家凯伦·R·朗称赞：“曼特尔用他的才华和智慧形象生动、天衣无缝地讲述了这个老生常谈的故事——托马斯·克伦威尔的权臣之路。”《西雅图时报》图书编辑和《好好读书》电视的搭档主持玛丽·安·格温也写道：“我从未如此深入一个人物的灵魂，更何况这个人物早已作古，离我很遥远。”（Picador出版社）
4. Marilynne Robinson, Gilead (2004)
 	玛丽琳·罗宾逊 ，《吉利德》（2004年）
The Rev John Ames, a small-town Iowa minister, describes his life and anti-slavery heritage to his young son in dazzling lyrical language in this first instalment of Robinson's trilogy (along with Home and Lila)."I can't think of a living novelist who writes more seriously and profoundly about religious faith," writes critic and author Dawn Raffel, who ranked Gilead first on her list. "Robinson is both an 'ideas' writer and an exquisite prose stylist, investigating the big questions within the intimate space of family and community. She is also a supremely good storyteller." Karen R Long, former book editor of the Cleveland Plain Dealer who now manages the Anisfield-Wolf book awards, adds, “This multi-generational story inculcates a desire for transcendence, and makes a case for spiritual life in the 21st Century – its own kind of miracle. Gilead will be read in 100 years.” (Picador)
	这是罗宾逊三部曲中的第一部（另外两部是《回家》和《莱拉》），小说中，约翰·艾姆斯是爱荷华州一个小镇上的传教士，他用令人印象深刻的抒情语言给小儿子讲述了自己的一生以及他们这个家族为废奴运动所做的努力。评论家、作家道恩·拉斐尔将《吉利德》列为其书单中的第一名，他这样评价：“所有在世作家中，罗宾逊在宗教信仰题材的创作上最为严谨、立意最为深刻。”《克利夫兰平原商报》前图书编辑、安斯菲尔德·沃尔夫图书奖现任负责人凯伦·R·朗也盛赞：“罗宾逊不仅是一个‘有想法’的作家，同时也是一个优秀的散文家，擅于描写家庭和社区私密空间中的重大问题。她非常擅长讲故事。这个故事涉及好几代人，反复灌输一种卓然超越的信仰，为21世纪的精神生活提供了一个范本——这本身就是一个奇迹。《吉利德》将是百年不朽的著作。”（Picador出版社）
Unless you think you’re the smartest, who doesn’t want to be smarter? Of course I want to be smarter too, so I try to find out who’s the real smart guy that maybe I can learn from. 	除非你觉得自己聪明绝顶无人能敌，谁不想变得再聪明一点呢？我也是，所以我就想看看能从那些聪明的家伙身上学到点什么。
1. They don’t talk as much as you, because they know they got smart by listening.	他们不会说太多，因为他们知道多听才能变聪明。
2. They know lots of things other than what they’re specialized in. Theirs is the gift of a broad mind, constantly fed with the stimulant of being interested in what everyone else is doing. 	除去专业知识之外，他们知道的很多。他们的天赋就是思维活跃，总是对其他人在做的事情充满好奇和兴趣。
3. They juggle home, work and personal interests with dexterity and never fall back on the tired old refrain about “work life balance”. And when they’re juggling, they somehow manage to seem 100% engaged with what they’re doing, on all fronts simultaneously, even though you know they’re taking appropriate steps behind the scenes to make sure their lives are perfectly, serenely balanced.	他们把家庭、工作和个人兴趣完美平衡，从来不会为”平衡工作和生活”这样的事情伤脑筋。当他们玩的时候，似乎会全身心的投入在这件事上面，他们面面俱到，虽然你很清楚，其实背后他们努力的走好每一步来让生活更加完美、更加平衡。
4. They probably do social media. Not always, but probably. It is not only another chance to listen, but one they use to ensure they can feed their brains with things they otherwise wouldn’t have come across.	也许他们会涉足社交媒体。不是一贯如此，只是有可能而已。这也是另外一个倾听的机会，但他们往往关注的是那些从没有经历过的事情。
5. Even when things go very badly wrong, they’ll be smiling. Smart people never get ruffled because their smart brains present them with alternatives faster than the bad stuff can happen.	即使事情发展很糟糕，他们也会面带微笑。聪明的人永远不会被打倒，他们的大脑永远都会在坏事发生之前，火速想好其他的解决方案。
6. They know they are usually the smartest person in the room, but they don’t spend their time dwelling on that. Instead, they take it as a personal challenge to see if they can make everyone else the smartest person in the room too.	他们知道自己是屋子里最聪明的人，但不会花时间去沾沾自喜。相反，他们会把这当做对自己的挑战：看他们是不是能把屋子里的其他人也变得一样的聪明。
7. If they are managers, they will make every effort to get people smarter, more connected and more popular than them in their teams. They’re not threatened because they know that smartness is synergistic. They also make sure that their smart people get to look smarter than them for the same reason.	如果他们是经理级别的人物，他们会努力让别人在整个团队中看上去比他们还要聪明、亲密和受欢迎。他们不会感到威胁，因为聪明有相互促进的作用。同理，他们也会确保这些聪明人看起来更聪明。
8. They have hidden skills that never get rolled out until they’re needed. They don’t have any need to show their full capabilities for reasons of proving they’re better than others.	不到万不得已，他们不会展现出自己的所有技能，无需仅仅为了证明自己比别人厉害而去秀自己的能力。
9. They may or may not have expensive educations. You’d never know, just by being with them unless you had their CV in front of you.	他们也许没有受到非常高端的教育，除非看到他们的简历，否则你永远都无从得知。
10. They never, ever, under any circumstances, make you look stupid, even though it would be easy to do so. They’ve learnt through bitter experience that the only thing that happens when you make someone look bad is you look bad yourself.	在任何情况下，他们绝对绝对不会让你看起来很愚笨，哪怕这是件轻而易举的事情。因为从过去的教训中他们学到的是，让别人出丑的唯一结果就是自己也出丑。
Now you should know who the smart people are. If you want to be the smart one, let me give you this extra advice from Steve Jobs “Stay hungry. Stay foolish.”	现在你应该知道谁才是聪明人了吧。如果你想变得聪明，再送你一句话，就是乔帮主那句经典的名言：”求知若饥，虚心若愚”。
Ayn Rand's novel, about the triumph of the individual over the tyranny of the collective, has sparked heated conversations and thoughtful dialogue for decades. Some of the celebrities mentioned on Mother Jones praised the book for its achievements and compelling characters (such as Rob Lowe and Billie Jean King). 	安·德兰的这本小说讲的是个人在集体的暴政下获得的胜利，点燃了数十年来激烈的谈论和值得深思的对话。一些知名人士在《琼斯母亲》杂志中提及这本小说时，赞扬了它取得的成绩以及书中引人注目的人物角色（例如：罗伯·劳、比利·简·金）。
Melville is a talented author whose masterpiece remains the story about an elusive whale, and its mad pursuer, Captain Ahab. 	梅尔维尔是一个极具天赋的作家，他的这本杰作讲的是一条令人捉摸不透的白鲸以及它的疯狂追捕者亚哈船长的故事。 
The narrator is not the only character with an exotic Biblical name (Ishmael), and there are as many themes to be had as fish in the sea. Moby Dick is a strangely destructive whale, who seems to take delight in capsizing and destroying the life of whaling vessels. 	故事的叙述者并不仅仅是有着来自圣经的外来名字（以赛玛利）的人物角色，还有许多关于海中的鱼的主题。主人公白鲸“异于常鲸”、极具破坏性，以摧毁捕鲸船为乐。
Captain Ahab's thirst for avenging his lost leg and ship prove to be his undoing. He makes a strange figure, teetering about his own ship on a leg made from a whale's jawbone, and seeking the prophetic mutterings of a harpoon crew member for clues on Moby Dick's location. Reading between the lines of whale oil and prophecy lies a fascinating tale of the nature of good and evil – and madness. 	亚哈船长对于自己失去的腿和船有着强烈的复仇欲望，这全是拜他所赐。他的外形古怪，摇摇晃晃地用他那取材自鲸鱼颚骨的腿驾驶着船只，根据一位鱼叉船员预言般的喃喃自语搜寻着白鲸的下落。字里行间的鲸脂油和预言仿佛把读者带到了一个令人神魂颠倒的神话中，探寻着善与恶甚至是疯狂的本质。
Winston and Julia are a young couple who meet under oppressive circumstances – he's an editor at the Ministry of Truth and she operates machines. Their habits of running away together, and thinking against the Party in the far-off land of Oceania, are noticed by the Thought Police. Throughout, history has no meaning except what the leaders give to it. This is one of the best books to read on the nature of totalitarian regimes, not because it's fiction, but because it has a ring of truth. 	温斯顿和茱莉亚是一对年轻的夫妇，他们的生活面临着窘境——他是真理部的一位编辑而她是一名机器操作员。他们一起逃跑的习性以及在思想上对于远在大洋洲的党派的反对引起了思想警察的注意。纵观全文，历史除了领导者赋予的意义外别无他意。这是关于极权政体本质最好的小说之一，不是因为这是一部虚构的作品，而是因为它是真理之环。
Out of Harvard Business School Press has come a 'must' on the business book list - Christensen's explanation of why technology changes can derail established companies. 	由于哈佛商学院出版社已经成为了商业图书清单的必备，克里斯坦森关于为何科技变革能够使得知名公司运行脱离轨道的阐释也成了必读之物。
This illustrated guide to Yoga was made popular in the 1970's, and truly lives up to its name. From psychedelic experimentation, to the path of inner discipline, Ram Dass explains why living in the present moment is an all-powerful spiritual concept. Steve Jobs thought it a profound work. 20	世纪70年代，配有插图的瑜伽书籍变得流行起来，这也无愧于它的名字。从迷幻的实验过程到内心的自我管理，拉姆·达斯阐述了为何活在当下是一个全能的精神概念。乔布斯认为这是一本深刻的书籍。
Horse aficionados may be surprised that the Zen mind begins with types of horses (excellent, good, poor, and bad) and how they respond to the requests of the rider. The paradoxes of growth and appreciation, struggle and enlightenment, situation versus being, are scattered throughout this 1970's classic. Not surprisingly, Steve Jobs added Suzuki's work to his favorites list, along with Be Here Now. 	马的狂热爱好者也许会对禅心是起源于不同类型的马（极好的、好的、一般的、差的）以及它们是如何回应骑者而感到惊讶。悖论如增长与欣赏、斗争与启蒙、情况相对等，在20世纪70年代的经典中举目皆是。史蒂芬·乔布斯把此书和《活在当下》一起列入他最爱的书单并不令人感到惊讶。
According to Elvis Presley's former spiritual advisor, Larry Geller, it apparently even made an impact on the consciousness of the King of Swing. The author shows an appreciation for the Western mind's demand for verifiable detail, while offering insights from a long line of Hindu yogis practicing mindfulness for many centuries. One of the most impactful chapters centers around a story of the author and his brother having a competition on the subject of God's providence – a long trip would have to be made without provision for food and without dependence on begging. 	根据埃维斯·普里斯利的前精神导师拉里·盖勒所说，这本书甚至对摇滚之王的意识产生了明显的影响。作者表达了对于西方思想追求可证的细节欣赏，同时也提出了印度瑜伽几世纪以来对于精神力量的修炼。其中最有影响力的章节之一主要讲述了作者与他的兄弟关于上帝旨意的竞争——一场没有实物供给并且不能依靠乞讨的漫长旅行的故事。
Chogyam Trungpa's groundbreaking work on the dangers of spiritual materialism was presented originally in Colorado, as a series of short talks in the 1970's. Years later, the material was striking enough for Steve Jobs to add it to his extensive reading list. Calling the process of the spiritual walk a “subtle process”, Trungpa outlines Buddhist philosophy and explains how spiritual growth is related to suffering, confusion, and the discovery of enlightenment beyond the tyranny of the ego. 	巴仁波切在精神唯物主义中的具有开创性的作品最初起源于科罗拉多，在20世纪70年代这只是一系列简短的交谈。数年后，因为这些材料足够具有震撼力而被史蒂芬·乔布斯加入了他的泛读书单里。召唤精神过程是一个“微妙的过程”，巴仁波切概述了佛教哲学，揭示了精神成长是如何与超越自我的残暴的磨难、困惑以及发现启示相互关联的。
Readers looking to expand their book lists may also want to see Trungpa's other works, such as “The Myth of Freedom” and “The Sacred Path of the Warrior”. 	希望扩大自己书单的读者也许会想要看看巴仁波切的其他作品，如《自由的迷思》和《勇士神圣之道》。
According to the Wall Street Journal, this book is one of coach Jim Harbaugh's favorite manuals for his football team, the San Francisco 49ers. As CEO, Grove steered Intel toward its status as top creator of computer chips that control our digital world, qualifying him to speak about the necessity of adaptation to instant corporate change. The milestones of change contain an instructive pattern, and Grove uses some of Intel's challenges (such as the Pentium processor flaw) to show what worked in keeping slightly ahead of Internet expansion: debate, anticipation of change, and seeking answers beyond the job title. 	据《华尔街日报》报道，这本书是教练吉姆·哈伯给足球队——旧金山49人队最爱的手册之一。作为首席执行官，格鲁夫带领英特尔取得了在控制数码世界中电脑芯片领域的领先创造者的地位，这给予了他讲述关于及时适应企业改变必要性的资格。变革的里程碑包含一种具有指导性的模式，格鲁夫通过英特尔的一些挑战（比如奔腾处理器的瑕疵）展示了是什么在保持略高于互联网膨胀中起了作用：辩论、对于变化的预测以及超出职位寻求答案。
Last year, there was only one book on my summer reading list that you could reasonably call a beach read. This year I tried to pick a few more things that are on the lighter side. Each of these books made me think or laugh or, in some cases, do both. I hope you find something to your liking here. And if it’s not summer where you live, this list will still be here six months from now…
	去年，在我的夏季读书清单中你只能找到一本读起来还算是轻松的。今年，我努力多挑了几本简单点的。这些书要么能让我认真思考要么能让我放声大笑，有时两者兼有。我希望在这里你能找到一些你喜欢的。如果你所生活的地方还没到夏天，那你还有六个月的时间来看这份清单……
The book, based on Brosh’s wildly popular website, consists of brief vignettes and comic drawings about her young life. The adventures she recounts are mostly inside her head, where we hear and see the kind of inner thoughts most of us are too timid to let out in public.
	这本书的写作基础来源于布洛什十分受欢迎的网站，上面有大量简短的插画和滑稽的漫画，描述的是她早年的生活。她所叙述的故事大多都是刻在她脑海里的，从中我们能听到并明白她的内心想法。而这一点，我们大多数人往往过于羞涩而不敢将自己的内心想法向外界宣泄。
You will rip through it in three hours, tops. But you’ll wish it went on longer, because it’s funny and smart as hell. I must have interrupted Melinda a dozen times to read to her passages that made me laugh out loud.
	这本书，最多三个小时你就能读完。但你会希望它再多讲一些，因为这本书写得既幽默风趣又富有智慧。每当读到令我大笑不已的部分，我总要打断梅琳达读给她听。
Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist at Oxford, has a gift for making science enjoyable. This book is as accessible as the TV series Cosmos is for younger audiences—and as relevant for older audiences. It’s an engaging, well-illustrated science textbook offering compelling answers to big questions, like “how did the universe form?” and “what causes earthquakes?”
	道金森是牛津大学的教授，著名的演化生物学家。在他的笔下，科学变得生动有趣。这本书就同科学纪录片《宇宙时空之旅》那样好理解，老少皆宜。这是一本十分引人入胜、配图精彩的科学手册，对一些深奥的问题给出了十分有力的回答，比如，“宇宙是如何形成的？”、“什么引发的地震？”。
It’s also a plea for readers of all ages to approach mysteries with rigor and curiosity. Dawkins’s antagonistic (and, to me, overzealous) view of religion has earned him a lot of angry critics, but I consider him to be one of the great scientific writer of all time.
	同时，这本书还极力使各个年龄段的读者在靠近神秘的事物时，既带着好奇心同时又不失严谨。道金森反宗教的态度受到了许多人愤怒的抨击，但我认为他是从始至今最棒的科学作家之一。
The subtitle of the book is “Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions,” and that’s exactly what it is. People write Munroe with questions that range over all fields of science: physics, chemistry, biology. Questions like, “From what height would you need to drop a steak for it to be cooked when it hit the ground?” (The answer, it turns out, is “high enough that it would disintegrate before it hit the ground.”)
	这本书的副标题是“对荒谬的假设性问题作出的十分科学性的解答”，的确如此。人们给门罗提出的问题涵盖了科学的各个范围：物理学，化学，生物学。提到的问题比如说，“烹饪牛排的时候需要抛多高才合适？”（这里给出的答案是“高到在牛排落回锅里摔成碎肉之前的高度。”）
Munroe’s explanations are funny, but the science underpinning his answers is very accurate. It’s an entertaining read, and you’ll also learn a bit about things like ballistics, DNA, the oceans, and the atmosphere.
	门罗的解答很风趣，但其中所蕴含的科学很准确。这本书能给你带来愉悦，同时你还能学到些东西，比如说，弹道学，DNA，海洋，以及大气层等。
There will be times when you have people above you (a boss) or even next to you (a coworker) that will get really irritated with you for "ruining" something "crucial". Errors are bound to happen when you have on your training wheels. Even if you make mistakes and get a slap on the wrist, persevere and push on. You do not need to be embarrassed for learning from your mistakes. 	有时候，你的上级甚至是你的同事会因为你把某件重要的事情搞砸了冲你发火。学习的时候犯错在所难免。即使犯错，会有惩罚也要坚持，不断向前进。你不需要为学习中犯的错而觉得不好意思。
People are different and have different taste buds. Whether it is healthy or not, food is a choice and it is a part of life. It is simply a personal choice that people make for their own reasons. You do not need to be embarrassed for food you do or do not like. Tell them, "It is a personal choice I have made, and I am committed to it."	青菜萝卜各有所爱。不管健康与否，食物都是一种选择，是生活的一部分。那只是别人根据自己的理由做出的个人选择。你不需要因为自己的口味而觉得不好意思。告诉他们，“那是我自己的个人选择，我就是要这些。”
Allowing positive experiences to define, confine, refine, and outshine you may cause you to be caught up in the past and unable to truly live in the present. Whether your history is positive, negative, or somewhere in between, don't hone in on the negative experiences and let it reflect your current behavior. 	让有积极意义的体验来定义、限制、提升、凸显你自己，你可能会因此陷入过去的泥淖，无法活在当下。无论你的过去是积极乐观的、消极抑郁的，或是介于两者之间，不要沉浸在过去不好的经历中，让它影响你现在的行为。
When everyone gets in the car, you realize your Starbucks bag are still on the floor. So what? Think about it this way: everyone has a "messy" aspect of their life. Maybe their home is spotless, but the relationship with their spouse is messy. Someone's car gets washed once a week, but his/her work life could use some help. No one on Earth lives a perfectly "clean" life in every aspect. We don't apologize to others about our personal pitfalls. By being outwardly embarrassed, it only brings more attention to the fact! 	当别人到你车里的时候，你才意识到星巴克的袋子还在里面。那又怎样？这样想：每个人在生活中都会有一个不太整洁的地方。也许他家纤尘不染，但是夫妻关系一团乱麻。有些人的车子每周清洁一次，但是他们的工作可能就需要别人的帮助。世上没人能在生活的各个方面都做到洁净无瑕。我们不必因为自己的缺陷向别人道歉。你表现出的尴尬只会更容易引起别人的注意。
If you find yourself saying no to something or making up lies to get out of it, tell them the truth, and don't apologize. You will feel much better in the long run if you are honest with them and yourself. If you're not up to a voluntary obligation, you don't have to be. You can politely deny the person's request. It is okay to be selfish from time to time. Put yourself first. 	如果你发现你想拒绝某件事或者说谎来摆脱，那就说出事实，你不必因此而觉得抱歉。对别人诚实，也终于内心，长期以后你会觉得这种感觉很不错。如果不是意定义务，你大可不必。你可以礼貌地拒绝对方的请求。有时候自私也没什么。把自己放在第一位。
Starting a new book is a risk, just like falling in love. You have to commit to it. You open the pages knowing a little bit about it maybe, from the back or from a blurb on the front. But who knows, right? Those bits and pieces aren't always right. 	读一本新书恰似坠入爱河，是场冒险。你得全身心投入进去。翻开书页之时，从序言简介直至封底你或许都知之甚少。但谁又不是呢？字里行间的只言片语亦不总是正确。
Sometimes people advertise themselves as one thing and then when you get deep into it you realize that they're something completely different. Either there was some good marketing attached to a terrible book, or the story was only explained in a superficial way and once you reach the middle of the book, you realize there's so much more to this book than anyone could have ever told you. 	有时候你会发现，人们自我推销时是一种形象，等你再深入了解后，他们又完全是另一种模样了。有时拙作却配有出色的市场推销，有时故事简介流于表面，阅读过半后，你方才发觉：这本书真是出乎意料地妙不可言，这种感受只要靠自己去感悟！
You start off slow. The story is beginning to unfold. You're unsure. It's a big commitment lugging this tome around. Maybe this book won't be that great but you'll feel guilty about putting it down. Maybe it'll be so awful you'll keep hate-reading or just set it down immediately and never pick it up again. Or maybe you'll come back to it some night, drunk or lonely — needing something to fill the time, but it won't be any better than it was when you first started reading it. 	你慢慢翻页，故事开始缓慢展开，而你却依旧心存犹疑。阅读这样的巨著需要百分之百的投入。或许它并不是你想象中的伟大的作品，奈何半途弃读会使你觉得不安。又或许，故事真的很烂，你要么咬牙苦读下去，要么立刻放弃束之高阁。抑或某个酒醉或孤寂的夜晚，你又重新捡起这本书来——但只为打发时光。不管怎样，它并没有比你初次阅读时好多少。
Maybe you're worn out. You've read tons of books before. Some were just light weights on a Kindle or Nook, no big deal really. Others were Infinite Jest-style burdens, heavy on your back or in your purse. Weighing you down all the time. Maybe you've taken some time off from reading because the last few books you read just weren't worth it. Do they even write new, great works of literature anymore? Maybe that time you fell in love with a book before will just never happen for you again. Maybe it's a once in a lifetime feeling and you're never gonna find it again. 	或许你已疲惫至极。你曾阅览无数，有些无足轻重无甚重要，而有些却像荒诞讽刺的包袱，沉重地压在你背上或藏在你行囊里，随时都可能压垮你。或许因为上次读的书索然无味，你已暂时避开阅读时光。还会有优秀的新文学作品么？只怕等你再次恋上一本书前，那优秀的新作品永远也不会出现罢。或许这真的就是千年等一回、除却巫山不是云了。
Or something exciting could happen. Maybe this will become your new favorite book. That's always a possibility right? That's the beauty of risk. The reward could actually be worth it. You invest your time and your brain power in the words and what you get back is empathy and a new understanding and pure wonder. 	当然，生活总会有新鲜事发生，你也会有新的爱书。一切总有可能，不是吗？这正是冒险的魅力。得到的也大抵物有所值吧。你在字里行间播撒时间和心思，自然便可收获新的感悟、理解与遐思。
How could someone possibly know you like this? Some stranger, some author, some character. It's like they're seeing inside your soul. This book existed inside some book store, on a shelf, maybe handled by other people and really it was just waiting for you to pick it up and crack the spine. It was waiting to speak to you. To say, "You are not alone." 	怎会有人知道你喜欢它呢？某个陌生人、作者，抑或书中的某个角色。他们似乎能看透你的心思。这本书，它陈列在某隅书店的书架上、它经人辗转，真的就像是在等你捧起翻阅，等着向你低语：“我会伴你左右。”
You just want more of the story. You want to keep reading, maybe everything this author's ever written. You wish it would never end. The closer it gets to the smaller side of the pages, the slower you read, wanting to savor it all. This book is now one of your favorites forever. You will always wish you could go back to never having read it and pick it up fresh again, but also you know you're better for having this close, inside you, covering your heart and mind. 	你渴望更多故事，你继续阅读，甚至搜集这位作者以往所有作品。你希望故事永远延续。书页越翻越薄，你也越读越慢，心里想着要细细含英咀华。此刻，它确定无疑就是你永恒的至爱了。你总想一读再读，每次捧起它都感觉新奇如初，而你也明白：因为内心深处的每一缕思绪都与它这般亲密，你已变得更加美好。
Once you get in deep enough, you know you could never put this book down. 	情动至深那刻，你便知道自己再也将它割舍不下了。 
The great benefit of living with, working for, or being related to people who have experienced more of life than you have is picking their brain for advice.
	和比你有生活经验的人一起生活、或为之工作、或和他们有联系的最大的益处莫过于可以从他们那里得到建议。
The most effective people learn from their own mistakes, and make a significant effort to learn from other people's errors as well.
	效率高的人会从自己的错误中学习，并努力从别人的错误中学习。
A recent Quora thread asked users for the best advice they've ever gotten. Here are a few of the greatest excerpts:
	最近Quora上有一个帖子，问用户得到的最好的建议是什么。其中最好的几条摘录如下：
"A very smart woman I worked with once told me that if I eliminated the word 'but' from my professional vocabulary, I'd find greater acceptance for my ideas, and greater cooperation from my team members... The word 'but' negates everything that precedes it, and you cast a negative spin on anything you say when you use it... 'But' is exclusive and isolating; 'and' is inclusive and welcoming."
	“和我一起工作的一位非常聪明的女士曾经告诉我，如果我把‘但是’这个词从我的工作用语中去掉，那我的想法被别人接受的概率会更高，我的团队成员间的合作程度也会更好……‘但是’这个词把它之前的内容都否定了，当你用它的时候，你说的话都蒙上了消极的色彩……‘但是’是排外的和孤立的；‘并且’是包容的、受欢迎的。”
"It was a professor in my university, but I believe its origin is from somebody famous: If you don't ask, the answer is always 'no'."
	“这句话是从我大学的一个教授那儿听到的，但我觉得这句话是源自一句名言：如果你不去问，那么答案永远是 ‘不’。”
"Don't complain. I think it was phrased as something like, 'Do you ever listen to someone complaining and think, This is a great conversation!?' Being negative doesn't help others, and it doesn't help you."
	“不要抱怨。换句话说，“你有没有听别人抱怨，然后想，恩，这次的谈话可真棒！？’消极并不会帮助他人，也不会对你有帮助。”
"A mentor I had some years ago told me that time is the one thing that you can never get back. If you look at it as an asset, you can donate it, spend it, or waste it. Whatever you do with it, it is gone once it passes."
	“几年之前我的导师告诉我，时间这个东西，你永远也不会重新得到。如果你把它看成是资产，你可以捐出它、花掉它或浪费掉。无论你怎么处理它，只要它过去了，它就再也不见了。”
"I have been time and again repeatedly told that a strong positive attitude takes a man farther than his talent. There are many greats in sports, entertainment, politics, science, and art who had great talent but lost on huge counts only because of a faulty and shaky attitude.
	“我被反复告诫，和天赋相比，积极的态度能让人走得更远。体育、娱乐、政治、科学和艺术等方面有很多人都富有天赋，但最终却输的很惨，原因就在于他们的态度不够端正。
Attitude helps you solve problems talent cannot. Attitude helps you navigate through problem talent hides."
	态度能帮你解决很多天赋解决不了的问题。态度能帮你在天赋所隐藏的问题中探索。”
"If you're going to do something, do it well enough to avoid doing it the second time. Going back to do something the second time is a time-waster if you knew it can be done right the first time. Even writing this post, I'm putting in my best effort into editing it, explaining it, and making it easy and enjoyable to read — to avoid going back and fixing any grammatical errors."
	“如果你要做什么事情，一定一次做好，不要再做第二遍。如果你知道第一次就能做好，那做两遍纯粹是浪费时间。即便是这个帖子，我也是尽力去编辑、去解释，让它易读，且读起来让人心情愉悦——避免再弄一次，去修改其中的语法错误。”
I asked a number of different people what advice they would give their younger selves. The responses are unedited below and are directly from responders to this question:
	我向许多人提了一个问题，即你想对过去的自己提些什么建议？下面直接列出人们给我的答案，未经任何修改。
1. You could run into anyone from your past in your future.
	在未来，你可能与任何过去认识的人不期而遇。
4. Set some goals so we can have a better life. We are much smarter than we think we are so stop second guessing yourself. Follow your instincts. We will get through anything and everything that life throws at us so don't despair.
	只有给自己树立目标，才能获得更好的生活。我们比你自认为的要聪慧的多，所以别再怀疑自己。追随你的直觉。生活抛给我们的任何困难，我们都能够一一克服，所以别失去信心。
5. Don't be so afraid of commitment. Sometimes it's the thing you're most scared of is the same thing that will end up setting you free.
	别害怕承诺。有时候恰恰正是你最害怕的东西能够最终让你获得自由。
Through the years, we've seen the participants experience deaths, divorce, and dramatic career setbacks. We've also seen them prevail against adversity.
	在纪录片中，我们可以看到参与拍摄的人们经历死亡、离婚、突发的职场挫折等等，也见证了他们走出逆境。
Over and over, we've seen the participants believe negative events meant their lives were finished. But people will gradually return to their personal “baseline” of happiness after a triumph or a tragedy.
	多少次，这些人认为他们人生中的挫折似乎意味着自己的生活完蛋了，然而并没有。人们在战胜困难或经受磨难后，会逐渐回归到最基本平常的幸福。
The key to happiness is to raise that baseline by cultivating an approach to life that emphasizes appreciation for the good things, as well as qualities like forgiveness and compassion.
	幸福的秘诀就是培养这样的人生态度：欣赏生命中美好的事情、培养宽容和富有同情心的素质。
The most troubled—and compelling—participants in the series are the ones that are also among the most grateful for what they have.
	纪录片中遇到麻烦最多、同时也最引人注目的角色，往往也是那些对自己所拥有的一切最懂得感恩的人。
Neil, for example, suffers severe mental illness and has been homeless and suicidal for long stretches of time. But Neil also provides the audience with many moments of grace, as when he recounts how grateful he is for long walks and conversations with friends.
	比如说，影片中的尼尔患有严重的精神疾病，很长时间都流浪在外、犹豫在自杀的边缘。但尼尔带给观众的，还有很多优雅的镜头：回想起和朋友们的长途漫步、促膝而谈，他感到很满足。
This sense of gratitude contributes powerfully to the resilience self-cure of Neil. People who live a life of pervasive thankfulness really do experience life differently than people who cheat themselves out of life by not feeling grateful.
	正是这种感恩的意识，促进了尼尔的恢复和自愈。对生活毫无感恩的人其实是欺骗了自己的生活，而对生活充满感恩的人、他们的生活体验真的与众不同。
The idea of spending a year away from home is something that appeals to nearly everyone. So why is taking a gap year still considered the wildcard?	几乎每个人都有想要出门放空一年的想法。但为何这样的举动仍被认为是疯狂的呢？
For a teenage student, the prospect of providing for yourself, miles away from home, can be daunting. But with an increasing number of gap year companies providing travel and trips abroad to suit any need, it is becoming easier to tailor a dream trip.	对于一个中学生来说，为自己计划一个离家数英里远的旅程，这想法的确让人望而生畏。但随着越来越多的“间隔年公司”的诞生，他们能满足人们外出及出国旅行的各种需求，因此为自己量身定制一个梦想之旅也变得更加容易了。
You can also find gap year companies that cover everything frominternships abroad to paid work and volunteering. Such companies offer ideas and inspiration to kickstart your travelling dream.	你还可以找一些提供各种服务的间隔年公司，比如海外实习、打工机会和志愿工作等等。这些公司可以为你提供各种点子，激励你开始追逐自己的旅行梦想。
But gap years don't have to be all about travel. You can have a beneficial year out of education and stay right where you are. Stephanie Wood wants to be a mental health nurse, but with allied health courses being some of the most exclusive and competitive around, she is taking a year off from education in order to gain an edge through work experience: "My plan is to get a job that directly relates to my course for the next few months, so I can really gain a deeper understanding of the healthcare system. Working there over a stretch of time will both give me an impression and insight into the working world of nursing – knowledge to help me through university when I choose to go."	然而间隔年并不仅仅意味着花一年时间全部用来旅行。你可以就呆在本地学习一年，让自己从中获益。斯蒂芬妮·伍德想要成为一名心理保健护士，但相关的健康课程非常专业并且具有挑战性，所以她休学一年，以便从实践工作中获得优势：“接下来几个月我打算在找到一份与我专业相关的工作，以便我能够从中更加深入的认识健康系统的意义。在那里工作一段时间不仅能够让我对护士工作有初步的印象，还能让我有所感悟，并学到将来上大学要用到的一些知识。
Choosing to take a year out can help you gain valuable experience as well as give you the opportunity to save up some funds to help you with accommodation when you get to university, living costs, food – or even just extra cash for freshers week.	选择花一年时间出去尝试新鲜事物不仅可以帮助你获得有价值的经验，还可以有机会赚点上大学的住宿费、餐食费或者至少是未来几周的零花钱。
Gap years aren't for everyone. Readjusting to an academic timetable after spending time abroad can be a shock. You also need to consider the practicalities, from financing your gap year to surviving without home comforts.	间隔年并非适合每个人，外出一年后归来，重新规划新的大学入学时间表也是一件费心费神的事情。在间隔年里，从经济上你要脱离父母、自食其力，因此你还需要考虑这个计划的可行性。
If you do discover that you want to see the world but still go back into education or work in September, you're in luck – this summer holiday is an extra long one for school leavers, so there's still plenty of time to book your ticket.	如果你想要出去看看，然后在九月时继续回到学校或者工作中，那么你很幸运，因为暑假马上就要来临了，学生们可以利用这段足够长的时间出去走走，而且你还有足够的时间来订票哦。
I cherish being around people who are totally comfortable with who they are. There always seems to be an aura of love and acceptance that follows these folks around.	在我眼里，悦己的人非常可贵。他们身上总是闪耀着爱和接纳的光环。
I think it’s because they’ve figured out one of the biggest secrets to life: The possibility of being loved and accepted grows exponentially when we can truly say we couldn’t be more comfortable with ourselves.	我认为这是因为他们找到了一个生活最大的秘密：当我们能够真正悦己时，我们被爱和被接纳的可能性才会更大。
People like being around those who are comfortable with themselves because they’re less threatening. We all feel the need to protect ourselves from threats aimed at our insecurities.	人们喜欢和悦己的人在一起，因为和他们在一起比较有安全感，而人都有远离威胁、打消不安全感的需求。
It can be exhausting to hang around folks who constantly poke at us just to gain some kind of external validation through making everyone else feel smaller.	有些人就为了通过使别人觉得自己渺小而获得外界的某种认可，总是来戳我们的伤口。和这样的人待在一起，我们会筋疲力尽。
My favorite thing about people who are comfortable with themselves is they need no external validation.	对于那些悦己的人，我很喜欢的一点就是他们不需要外界的认可。
They have discovered their worth is intrinsic and, by nature, something that cannot be taken away or added to based on what other people think.	他们已经发现自己的价值是内在的、是与生俱来的，不会被别人抢走，也不会因为别人的看法而增加。
Ironically enough, this ends up providing comfortable people with more external validation than those who feel they need it most.	讽刺的是，相较于那些非常渴望别人认可的人来说，悦己的人最终能得到更多的外界认可。
Because comfortable people’s worth comes from within, they see no point in tearing others down. To them, the only sensible way to speak about another is positively.	因为悦己的人的价值来自于内在，他们觉着诋毁别人没有意义。对他们而言，积极地谈论别人才是唯一明智的方式。
I guess when you realize your worth comes from within, you might as well build others up rather than tear them down, since their size is of no threat to your sense of self-worth.	我想当你意识到你的价值来自内心的时候，你倒不如赞美别人、而不是诋毁他们，因为他们并不会威胁到你的自尊。
Plus, it’s a lot more fun to speak love to others and watch their eyes glow than it is to hurt someone’s feelings for a cheap laugh, anyway.	此外，对别人说出你的爱、看着他们眼里充满喜悦，这要比小气地嘲笑别人而伤害他们要更乐趣。
When we become comfortable with ourselves through fully accepting who we are, we can silence the noise our insecurities make in public situations and become more attuned to the wonderful reality that unfolds before us.	当我们完全接受自己、完全悦己时，我们就能够使在公众场合产生的不安感销声匿迹，也更能理解眼前的美好。
The result is a world with fewer insecurities. To me, that sounds like a better world.	因此，世界上的不安感就会减少，对我来说，那就是一个更美好的世界。
When you start reciting positive quotes, you will start to build the confidence. When you approach your boss with confidence, he is more likely to take you seriously and believe in your worth to earn more money.
	当你开始记住这些名言时，你能建立起自信心。当你在老板面前展示出你的自信之后，他可能会更认真的考量你，相信你能为他创造出更多的价值。
“To become convinced that you can succeed is the first requisite to success.” - Wallace D. Wattles
	“相信自己能取得成功是成功的必要条件” ——华特斯
You must believe in yourself and your ability to accomplish anything you set out to do. When you convince yourself that you can succeed, you set yourself up to get what you want. No matter your circumstances, tell yourself that you deserve to have affluence in your life.
	你一定要相信你自己，相信你有能力做到你想要做的任何事。一旦你自己说服自己能取得成功，你就能得到你想要的东西。不管你身处何种环境，告诉自己：你本该生活富足。
“It is a mistake to look too far ahead. Only one link to the chain of destiny can be handled at a time.” - Sir Winston Churchill
	“想要对未来做出太多的预测通常是错误的。每一次我们只能抓住命运锁链的一个链结。 ” ——丘吉尔爵士
Even though you have the ability to become a multimillionaire, don’t get upset if it doesn’t happen overnight. You need to take baby steps to build your business or demonstrate your competence for a raise. Set an income goal with a deadline and construct a simple plan to achieve it. Now all you have to do is execute it. Just remember to be patient with yourself and take one task at a time.
	即使你有能力成为一个大富豪，如果没有一夜暴富也不要悲伤。你需要一步一步的创立自己的事业或者依靠自己的能力要求涨薪。给自己设立一个有限期的收入目标，并为此定好一个计划。你现在要做的就是去执行你的计划。记住要对自己有耐心，一个任务一个任务的完成。
“Try to become not a man of success, but rather a man of value.” - Albert Einstein
	“不要老想着做一个成功人士，而是要做一个有价值的人。” ——爱因斯坦
Success is in the eye of the beholder. Your friends and family are not afraid to tell you what you are good at. Listen to them and use those skills while you work. People will pay you for your work when it adds value to their immediate needs.
	成功是别人对你的看法。你的家人朋友勇于告诉你你最擅长的是哪些方面。听听他们的意见，工作的时候用上这些技巧。当你给他们创造出价值的时候他们会为你的付出支付给你薪酬。
“If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss your ass good bye!” - Michael Port
	“如果你想要满足所有人，那你不妨说再见” ——波特
When you try to please everyone, you’re bound to disappoint someone. Quit trying to please everyone and follow your ideal career path. You will continue to earn more money when you’re a leader in your area of expertise.
	当你试着想要让所有人都满意的时候，你肯定会让一些人失望。不要试着满足所有人，按着你理想的职业道路行进就好。当你成为某个领域的专家的时候，你会赚更多钱。
The title, Wa, has different meanings. First of all, it is a homophone, part of the name nvwa (	女娲), the legendary goddess who created human beings and patched up the sky. Secondly, this character is close to wa (娃), meaning "child". Thirdly, frogs are known for their fertility and thus are totemic animals in certain areas of China.
Like laughter, sunshine, and fresh air; singing elevates our moods. Studies have shown that singing triggers a release of endorphins, which are the body’s natural way of chemically relieving pain and stress. When we’re happier, we get more done. This might be why Snow White likes to whistle while she works. 	说真的，像微笑，阳光，新鲜的空气，唱歌都能保持好心情。研究证明唱歌能激发身体释放出一种荷尔蒙，这是身体自然的释放减轻痛苦和释放压力的最自然方式。快乐的时候，我们能得到更多。这也许就是白雪公主在工作时唱歌的原因。 
It is a simple but useful motivational technique because when you form a picture of succeeding in your mind, you begin to see the possibility of reaching your goal. 	很简单，但是是很有用的激励技巧，因为当你在头脑里面有一个明确的样子的时候，就开始看见梦想实现的可能性。 
Writing down your goals and reflecting regularly on their progress helps you to both focus on the desired outcome and holds you accountable. While financial stability is only one quantifiable way to measure success. 	写下你的目标，定期的反应你的进步能让你关注想要的结果，敦促你自己。但经济稳定是唯一一个反应成功的可量化方式。 
While this can be a useful way to motivate students to complete homework, it can also work well for anyone who has a hard time settling down to work. While this might not work for everyone, I’ve always found that glancing up now and then to make a comment about something I’ve read does more than allow for a break in the action. 	虽然这可能是激励学生完成作业一个有用的方法,这对于那种有难安定下来工作的人来说也是极有校的。但这可能并不适合每一个人，我们总能发现先看一眼，然后就能继续做那件我们承诺要做的事，而不会半途而废。 
Like the other visualization techniques we’ve talked about, this practice keeps your eye on the prize, and it’s a conscious form of procrastination unless you meet that deadline, which inevitably forces your mind back on work. 	正如我之前提到的那些可视技巧一样，这种方法也会让你获得注意力上的集中，也是一种有意识的避免在截至日以前的拖延，这种方法能有效的把你的思维拉回到工作中。
In your twenties it's easy to feel like you're invincible. That fast food and the five margaritas you downed the night before burn right off and you wake up the next morning feeling fine. This does not last. Start building healthy habits now before they catch up to you later. At 30, I'm still struggling with this one myself. Get in the habit of eating healthfully and exercising. Your body will thank you for years later.20	几岁的时候，你很容易觉得自己所向披靡。吃个快餐、晚上喝的五杯玛格丽塔酒酒劲还没过，第二天醒来还感觉良好。但这持续不了多久的。在身体垮掉之前赶紧养成健康的习惯。30岁的时候，我仍旧在和自己的健康作斗争。习惯吃得健康一点，做做运动。几年之后，你的身体状况会感激你现在所作出的努力。
Your twenties is a time when most are relatively free of the responsibilities that will increase into your thirties and forties. This is a great time to experiment, fail, and bounce back. Learn how to ride out failure and persevere. Life is full of challenges. The twenties are a great time to toughen up and start teaching yourself how to be emotionally and mentally resilient enough to weather both the joys and hardships to come.20	几岁是你最自由的时候，到了30岁和40岁的时候，责任就相对增加很多了。这是去尝试、失败、重新振作的最佳时期。学着怎么从失败当中爬起来并且坚持下去。生活中充满挑战。无论幸福还是悲伤，20岁都是你吃苦和学会怎么从精神上和身体上振作的最佳时期。
I felt like a failure throughout my twenties because most of my university friends seemed happy in corporate jobs that made me miserable. I felt constant pressure to fit a specific mold. It's only within the past year that I've started to come to terms with who I really am and what really makes me happy. Life is not one-size-fits-all. Choose the career and lifestyle that are true to you, not a version of that you wish you were.20	几岁的时候我觉得自己很失败，因为我大多数的大学同学都有着幸福的工作，这让我觉得自己很可悲。为了一定的目标，我不断给自己施加压力。过去的一年里，我才真正开始思考我到底是个什么样的人，什么才能使我快乐。没有任何一种生活方式能适合所有人。选择你自己真正想要的生活方式跟职业，而不是像你所希望的那样。
Learn smart financial management now. Learn how to live within a budget and maintain good credit. A mistake I once made, and one I still see a number of my peers making, is being a slave to lifestyle: taking cabs everywhere, buying expensive clothing, and having meals out constantly. This is stupid and reckless. I know people who were left completely adrift despite having made great salaries because they had no savings when their careers hit a rough patch. Their income was spent all on things that are frivolous. Luxuries are a wonderful thing only if you can truly afford them. Don't be a slave to funding a lifestyle that will not last. Learn to live modestly and save up, and then you will have earned the right to purchase yourself some treats, in moderation.	现在开始，学些理财知识吧。学着怎么在不打破预算的情况下生活，还保持良好的信用额度。我曾经犯过一个错误，现在我仍旧看见我的很多朋友在犯这个错误，那就是成为了生活方式的奴隶：无论去哪儿都打的，买昂贵的衣服，还有经常去外面吃饭。这是愚蠢和鲁莽的。我见过那种人，尽管工资很高，但是当他们的工作遇到困难的时候却因为没有积蓄而彻底绝望。他们把所有的收入都用在那些没有意义的东西上。只有当你真正能负担得起的时候，奢侈才是恰到好处。不要去选择一种不会持久的奴隶的生活方式。学会谦虚地生活还有节约，然后你就可以有节制地给自己来个奖励。
Time is a precious commodity and you start to realize that increasingly into your mid to late twenties. Choose your friends wisely. Separate yourself from toxic or negative influences, those who would waste your time, and those who encourage you to focus on the unimportant. Seek out people who give you happiness, who inspire you, who support you, and nourish those relationships instead.	在你二十五六岁时候你会开始发现，时间是一件珍贵的商品。明智地选择你的朋友。不要让自己被有害的的或者消极的人所影响，那些人只会浪费你的时间，他们只会让你专注于那些不重要的事情上。看看谁能给你带来幸福，谁激励你，谁支持你，让你们之间的关系升温。
1. Happiness is not about being immortal nor having food or rights in one's hand. It's about having each tiny wish come true, or having something to eat when you are hungry or having someone's love when you need love.
	幸福，不是长生不老，不是大鱼大肉，不是权倾朝野。幸福是每一个微小的生活愿望达成。当你想吃的时候有得吃，想被爱的时候有人来爱你。
2. One is always on a strange road, watching strange scenery and listening to strange music. Then one day, you will find that the things you try hard to forget are already gone.
	一个人总要走陌生的路，看陌生的风景，听陌生的歌，然后在某个不经意的瞬间，你会发现，原本是费尽心机想要忘记的事情真的就那么忘记了。
3. Love is a lamp, while friendship is the shadow. When the lamp is off, you will find the shadow everywhere. Friend is who can give you strength at last.
	爱情是灯，友情是影子，当灯灭了，你会发现你的周围都是影子。朋友，是在最后可以给你力量的人。
4. I love you not for who you are, but for who I am before you.
	我爱你不是因为你是谁，而是我在你面前可以是谁。
6. If you can hold something up and put it down, it is called weight-lifting; if you can hold something up but can never put it down, it's called burden-bearing. Pitifully, most of people are bearing heavy burdens when they are in love.
	举得起放得下的叫举重，举得起放不下的叫负重。可惜，大多数人的爱情，都是负重的。
7. We all live in the past. We take a minute to know someone, one hour to like someone, and one day to love someone, but the whole life to forget someone.
	我们每个人都生活在各自的过去中，人们会用一分钟的时间去认识一个人，用一小时的时间去喜欢一个人，再用一天的时间去爱上一个人，到最后呢，却要用一辈子的时间去忘记一个人。
8. One may fall in love with many people during the lifetime. When you finally get your own happiness, you will understand the previous sadness is kind of treasure, which makes you better to hold and cherish the people you love.
	一个人一生可以爱上很多的人，等你获得真正属于你的幸福之后，你就会明白一起的伤痛其实是一种财富，它让你学会更好地去把握和珍惜你爱的人。
9. When you are young, you may want several love experiences. But as time goes on, you will realize that if you really love someone, the whole life will not be enough. You need time to know, to forgive and to love. All this needs a very big mind.
	年轻的时候会想要谈很多次恋爱，但是随着年龄的增长，终于领悟到爱一个人，就算用一辈子的时间，还是会嫌不够。慢慢地去了解这个人，体谅这个人，直到爱上为止，是需要有非常宽大的胸襟才行。
10. When tomorrow turns in today, yesterday, and someday that no more important in your memory, we suddenly realize that we r pushed forward by time. This is not a train in still in which you may feel forward when another train goes by. It is the truth that we've all grown up. And we become different.
	当明天变成了今天成为了昨天，最后成为记忆里不再重要的某一天，我们突然发现自己在不知不觉中已被时间推着向前走，这不是静止火车里，与相邻列车交错时，仿佛自己在前进的错觉，而是我们真实的在成长，在这件事里成了另一个自己。
11. If you leave me, please don't comfort me because each sewing has to meet stinging pain.
	离开我就别安慰我，要知道每一次缝补也会遭遇穿刺的痛。
12. Don't forget the things you once you owned. Treasure the things you can't get. Don't give up the things that belong to you and keep those lost things in memory.
	曾经拥有的，不要忘记。不能得到的，更要珍惜。属于自己的，不要放弃。已经失去的，留作回忆。
13. I love and am used to keeping a distance with those changed things. Only in this way can I know what will not be abandoned by time. For example, when you love someone, changes are all around. Then I step backward and watching it silently, then I see the true feelings.
	我喜欢并习惯了对变化的东西保持着距离，这样才会知道什么是最不会被时间抛弃的准则。比如爱一个人，充满变数，我于是后退一步，静静的看着，直到看见真诚的感情。
14. Men love from overlooking while women love from looking up. If love is a mountain, then if men go up, more women they will see while women will see fewer men.
	男人的爱是俯视而生，而女人的爱是仰视而生。如果爱情像座山，那么男人越往上走可以俯视的女人就越多，而女人越往上走可以仰视的男人就越少。
15. Good love makes you see the whole world from one person while bad love makes you abandon the whole world for one person.
	好的爱情是你通过一个人看到整个世界，坏的爱情是你为了一个人舍弃世界。
16. We shall always save a place for ourselves, only for ourselves. And then begin to love. Have no idea of what it is, who he is, how to love or how long it will be. Just wait for one love. Maybe no one will come out, but this kind of waiting is the love itself.
	在自己面前，应该一直留有一个地方，独自留在那里。然后去爱。不知道是什么，不知道是谁，不知道如何去爱，也不知道可以爱多久。只是等待一次爱情，也许永远都没有人。可是，这种等待，就是爱情本身。
17. Is there anyone who hasn't suffered for the secret love? We always think that love is very heavy, heavy and could be the heaviest thing in the world. But one day, when you look back, you suddenly realize that it's always light, light. We all thought love was very deep, but in fact it's very thin. The deepest and heaviest love must grow up with the time.
	有谁不曾为那暗恋而痛苦?我们总以为那份痴情很重，很重，是世上最重的重量。有一天，暮然回首，我们才发现，它一直都是很轻，很轻的。我们以为爱的很深，很深，来日岁月，会让你知道，它不过很浅，很浅。最深和最重的爱，必须和时日一起成长。
18. In this world, only those men who really feel happy can give women happiness.
	在这个世界上，只有真正快乐的男人，才能带给女人真正的快乐。
19. If a woman is not sexy, she needs emotion; if she is not emotional, she needs reason; if she is not reasonable, she has to know herself clearly. Only she has is misfortune.
	女人如果不性感，就要感性;如果没有感性，就要理性;如果没有理性，就要有自知之明;如果连这个都没有了，她只有不幸。
20. An unacceptable love needs no sorrow but time- sometime for forgetting. A badly-hurt heart needs no sympathy but understanding.
	一段不被接受的爱情，需要的不是伤心，而是时间，一段可以用来遗忘的时间。一颗被深深伤了的心，需要的不是同情，而是明白。
21. I know someone in the world is waiting for me, although I've no idea of who he is. But I feel happy every day for this.
	我知道这世上有人在等我，但我不知道我在等谁，为了这个，我每天都非常快乐。
22. In your life, there will at least one time that you forget yourself for some one, asking for no result, no company, no ownership nor love. Just ask for meeting you in my most beautiful years.
	一生至少该有一次，为了某个人而忘了自己，不求有结果，不求同行，不求曾经拥有，甚至不求你爱我。只求在我最美的年华里，遇到你。
23. When you feel hurt and your tears are gonna to drop. Please look up and have a look at the sky once belongs to us. If the sky is still vast, clouds are still clear, you shall not cry because my leave doesn't takeaway the world that belongs to you.
	当你的心真的在痛，眼泪快要流下来的时候，那就赶快抬头看看，这片曾经属于我们的天空;当天依旧是那么的广阔，云依旧那么的潇洒，那就不应该哭，因为我的离去，并没有带走你的世界。
24. I don't think that when people grow up, they will become more broad-minded and can accept everything. Conversely, I think it's a selecting process, knowing what's the most important and what's the least. And then be a simple man.
	我不觉得人的心智成熟是越来越宽容涵盖，什么都可以接受。相反，我觉得那应该是一个逐渐剔除的过程，知道自己最重要的是什么，知道不重要的东西是什么。而后，做一个纯简的人。
In your twenties it's easy to feel like you're invincible. That fast food and the five margaritas you downed the night before burn right off and you wake up the next morning feeling fine. This does not last. Start building healthy habits now before they catch up to you later. At 30, I'm still struggling with this one myself. Get in the habit of eating healthfully and exercising. Your body will thank you for years later.
20	几岁的时候，你很容易觉得自己所向披靡。吃个快餐、晚上喝的五杯玛格丽塔酒酒劲还没过，第二天醒来还感觉良好。但这持续不了多久的。在身体垮掉之前赶紧养成健康的习惯。30岁的时候，我仍旧在和自己的健康作斗争。习惯吃得健康一点，做做运动。几年之后，你的身体状况会感激你现在所作出的努力。
Your twenties is a time when most are relatively free of the responsibilities that will increase into your thirties and forties. This is a great time to experiment, fail, and bounce back. Learn how to ride out failure and persevere. Life is full of challenges. The twenties are a great time to toughen up and start teaching yourself how to be emotionally and mentally resilient enough to weather both the joys and hardships to come.
20	几岁是你最自由的时候，到了30岁和40岁的时候，责任就相对增加很多了。这是去尝试、失败、重新振作的最佳时期。学着怎么从失败当中爬起来并且坚持下去。生活中充满挑战。无论幸福还是悲伤，20岁都是你吃苦和学会怎么从精神上和身体上振作的最佳时期。

It's only within the past year that I've started to come to terms with who I really am and what really makes me happy. Life is not one-size-fits-all.

20	几岁的时候我觉得自己很失败，因为我大多数的大学同学都有着幸福的工作，这让我觉得自己很可悲。为了一定的目标，我不断给自己施加压力。过去的一年里，我才真正开始思考我到底是个什么样的人，什么才能使我快乐。没有任何一种生活方式能适合所有人。选择你自己真正想要的生活方式跟职业，而不是像你所希望的那样。

DURING dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank -- such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but he had never seen any thing but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself, -- some shelves in the closets up stairs.
	吃饭的时候，班纳特先生几乎一句话也没有说;可是等到佣人们走开以后，他就想道，现在可以跟这位客人谈谈了。他料想到，如果一开头就谈到咖苔琳夫人身上去，这位贵客一定会笑逐颜开的，于是他便拿这个话题做开场白，说是柯林斯先生有了那样一个女施主，真是幸运极了，又说咖苔琳·德·包尔夫人对他这样言听计从，而且极其周到地照顾到他生活方面的安适，真是十分难得。班纳特先生这个话题选得再好也没有了。柯林斯先生果然滔滔不绝地赞美起那位夫人来。这个问题一谈开了头，他本来的那种严肃态度便显得更严肃了，他带着非常自负的神气说，他一辈子也没有看到过任何有身价地位的人，能够象咖苔琳夫人那样的有德行，那样的亲切谦和。他很荣幸，曾经当着她的面讲过两次道，多蒙夫人垂爱，对他那两次讲道赞美不绝。夫人曾经请他到罗新斯去吃过两次饭，上星期六晚上还请他到她家里去打过“夸锥”。据他所知，多少人都认为咖苔琳夫人为人骄傲，可是他只觉得亲切。她平常跟他攀谈起来，总是把他当作一个有身份的人看待。她丝毫不反对他和邻居们来往，也不反对他偶而离开教区一两个星期，去拜望拜望亲友们。多蒙她体恤下情，曾经亲自劝他及早结婚，只要他能够谨慎选择对象。她还到他的寒舍去拜访过一次，对于他住宅所有经过他整修过的地方都十分赞成，并且蒙她亲自赐予指示，叫他把楼上的璧橱添置几个架子。
"That is all very proper and civil I am sure," said Mrs. Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?"
	班纳特太太说：“我相信这一切都做得很得体，很有礼貌，我看她一定是个和颜悦色的女人。可惜一般贵夫人们都比不上她。她住的地方离你很近吗，先生？”
"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings park, her ladyship's residence."
	“寒舍那个花园跟她老夫人住的罗新斯花园，只隔着一条胡同。”
"I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?"
	“你说她是个寡妇吗，先生？她还有家属吗？”
"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property."
	“她只有一个女儿，──也就是罗新斯的继承人，将来可以继承到非常大的一笔遗产呢。”

"Ah!" cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?"
	“嗳呀，”班纳特太太听得叫了起来，一面又摇了摇头。“那么，她比多少姑娘们都福气她。她是怎样的一位小姐？长得漂亮吗？”
"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."
	“她真是个极可爱的姑娘。咖苔琳夫人自己也说过，讲到真正的漂亮，德·包尔小姐要胜过天下最漂亮的女性；因为她眉清目秀，与众不同，一看上去就知道她出身高贵。她本来可以多才多艺，只可惜她体质欠佳，没有进修，否则她一定琴棋书画样样通晓，这话是她女教师说给我听的，那教师现在还跟她们母女住在一起。她的确是可爱透顶，常常不拘名份，乘着她那辆小马车光临寒舍。”

"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court."
	“她觐见过皇上吗？在进过宫的仕女们中，我好象没有听见过她的名字。”
"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. -- These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay."
	“不幸她身体柔弱，不能过京城去，正如我有一天跟咖苔琳夫人所说的，这实在使得英国的宫庭里损失了一件最明媚的装璜；她老人家对我这种说法很是满意。你们可以想象得到，在任何场合下，我都乐于说几句巧妙的恭维话，叫一般太太小姐们听得高兴。我跟咖苔琳夫人说过好多次，她的美丽的小姐是一位天生的公爵夫人，将来不管嫁给哪一位公爵姑爷，不论那位姑爷地位有多高，非但不会增加小姐的体面，反而要让小姐来为他争光。这些话都叫她老人家听得高兴极了，我总觉得我应该在这方面特别留意。”

"You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"
	班纳特先生说：“你说得很恰当，你既然有这种才能，能够非常巧妙地捧人家的场，这对于你自己也会有好处。我是否可以请教你一下，你这种讨人喜欢的奉承话，是临时想起来的呢，还是老早想好了的？”
"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible."
	“大半是看临时的情形想起来的；不过有时候我也自己跟自己打趣，预先想好一些很好的小恭维话，平常有机会就拿来应用，而且临说的时候，总是要装出是自然流露出来的。”

Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.
	班纳特先生果然料想得完全正确，他这位表侄确实象他所想象的那样荒谬，他听得非常有趣，不过表面上却竭力保持镇静，除了偶而朝着伊丽莎白望一眼以外，他并不需要别人来分享他这份愉快。
By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. -- Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. -- Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with,
	不过到吃茶的时候，这一场罪总算受完了。班纳特先生高高兴兴地把客人带到会客室里，等到茶喝完了，他又高高兴兴地邀请他朗诵点什么给他的太太和小姐们听。柯林斯先生立刻就答应了，于是她们就拿了一本书给他，可是一看到那本书（因为那本书一眼就可以看出是从流通图书馆借来的）他就吃惊得往后一退，连忙声明他从来不读小说，请求她们原谅。吉蒂对他瞪着眼，丽迪雅叫起来了。于是她们另外拿了几本书来，他仔细考虑了一下以后，选了一本弗迪斯的《讲道集》。他一摊开那本书，丽迪雅不禁目瞪口呆，等到他那么单调无味，一本正经地刚要读完三页的时候，丽迪雅赶快岔断了他：
"Do you know, mama, that my uncle philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town."
	“妈妈，你知不知道腓力普姨爹要解雇李却？要是他真的要解雇他，弗斯脱上校一定愿意雇他。这是星期六那一天姨爹亲自告诉我的。我打算明天上麦里屯去多了解一些情况，顺便问问他们，丹尼先生什么时候从城里回来。”
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,
	两个姐姐都吩咐丽迪雅住嘴；柯林斯先生非常生气，放下了书本，说道：
"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess; -- for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin."
	“我老是看到年轻的小姐们对正经书不感兴趣，不过这些书完全是为了她们的好处写的。老实说，这不能不叫我惊奇，因为对她们最有利益的事情，当然莫过于圣哲的教训。可是我也不愿意勉强我那年轻的表妹。”
Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.
	于是他转过身来要求班纳特先生跟他玩“贝加梦”，班纳特先生一面答应了他，一面说，这倒是个聪明的办法，还是让这些女孩子们去搞她们自己的小玩艺吧。班纳特太太和她五个女儿极有礼貌地向他道歉，请他原谅丽迪雅打断了他朗诵对书，并且说，他要是重新把那本书读下去，她保证决不会有同样的事件发生。柯林斯先生请她们不要介意，说是他一点儿也不怪表妹，决不会认为她冒犯了他而把她怀恨在心。他解释过以后，就跟班纳特先生坐到另一张桌子上去，准备玩“贝加梦”。
“Good morning,” the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.	“早上好，”小王子彬彬有礼地回答。他转过身，却没看到什么人。
“I am right here,” the voice said, “under the apple tree.”	“我在这儿呢，苹果树底下，”这声音提醒他。
“Who are you?” asked the little prince, and added, “You are very pretty to look at.”	“你是谁？”小王子问道，“你长得真漂亮。”
“Come and play with me,” proposed the little prince. “I am so unhappy.”	“和我一起玩吧，”小王子向狐狸建议，“我苦恼极了。”
“I cannot play with you,” the fox said. “I am not tamed.”	“我不能和你玩，”狐狸说，“我还没有被你驯养呢。”
“Ah! Please excuse me,” said the little prince. But, after some thought, he added: “What does that mean—‘tame’?”	“啊！对不起，”小王子说道。但是他思索了一会儿，又说：“‘驯养’是什么意思？”
“You do not live here,” said the fox. “What is it that you are looking for?”	“你不是本地人，”狐狸说道，“你来这儿找寻什么呢？”
“I am looking for men,” said the little prince. “What does that mean—‘tame’?”	“我正在找人，”小王子答道，“‘驯养’是什么意思？”
“Men,” said the fox. “They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?”	“人，”狐狸说道，“人有枪，他们会打猎。这可真讨厌。他们养鸡。这两件事是他们唯一的爱好。你也寻找鸡吗？”
“No,” said the little prince. “I am looking for friends. What does that mean—‘tame’?”	“不，”小王子说道，“我是来找朋友的。‘驯养’是什么意思呢？
“It is an act too often neglected,” said the fox. “It means to establish ties .”	“它是经常被人们遗忘的一种行为，”狐狸答道，“它的意思是‘建立联系’。”
“Just that,” said the fox. “To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world...”	“当然了，”狐狸说道，“对我来说，你与其他成千上万个小男孩没什么区别。我不需要你，你也不需要我。对你来说，我与其他成千上万只狐狸毫无差别。但是，如果你驯服了我，我们就谁也离不开谁了。那时候，对我来说，在这个世界上你就是独一无二的。而对你而言，我也是这个世界上独一无二的……”
“I am beginning to understand,” said the little prince. “There is a flower... I think that she has tamed me...”	“我有点明白了，”小王子说，“我有一朵花……我想，她已经驯服了我……”
“It is possible,” said the fox. “On the Earth one sees all sorts of things… ”	“这是可能的，”狐狸说，“在这个地球上，什么千奇百怪的事情都有可能发生……”
“My life is very monotonous ,” the fox said. “I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow . And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder ? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the colour of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat... ”	“我的生活单调乏味，”狐狸说，“我捉鸡，人捉我。所有的鸡都是一模一样的，所有的人也都是一模一样的。因此，我感到有些厌烦了。但是如果你驯服了我，我的生活将会充满阳光和欢乐。我将会分辨出一种与众不同的脚步声。听到别的脚步声，我会急急忙忙躲进地下洞穴。而唯独你的脚步声会像音乐一样，唤我出洞。再说，你瞧瞧，你看到那边的麦田了吗？我从来不吃面包，小麦也对我毫无用处。麦田也不会使我产生任何联想。这是多么可悲啊！但是，你有一头金黄色的头发。一旦你驯养我，想象一下那该是多美好的事啊：那金黄色的小麦会让我联想起你来。于是，我也会喜欢听穿过麦田的风声……”
The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time. “Please—tame me!” he said.	狐狸盯着小王子看了很久。“请你……请你驯养我吧！”狐狸最后说道。
“I want to, very much,” the little prince replied. “But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.”	“我很想驯养你，”小王子回答道，“但是我没有那么多时间。我得去找朋友，还要去学习理解许多许多的事情。”
“One only understands the things that one tames,” said the fox. “Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me... ”	“只有被人们驯服了的事物，才能被人们所理解，”狐狸说道，“人们再也没有时间去认识新的事物了。他们总是到商店里买现成的东西。但是，世界上还没有贩卖友谊的商店，因此人们再也没有朋友了。要是你想交一个朋友，就请驯养我吧……”
“What must I do, to tame you?” asked the little prince.	“驯养你，那我应该怎么做呢？”小王子问道。
“You must be very patient,” replied the fox. “First you will sit down at a little distance from me—like that—in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day... ”	“你必须很耐心，”狐狸答道，“首先，你坐在草地上，离我有一些距离——就像这样。我偷偷地用眼角观察你，你什么也别说。言语是误会的根源。但是，你每天都可以坐得离我更近一些……”
“It would have been better to come back at the same hour,” said the fox. “If, for example, you come at four o’clock in the afternoon, then at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper rites... ”	“你最好每天都在同一个时刻过来，”狐狸说道，“比如说你下午四点来，那我从三点开始就会感到快乐。离四点越近，我就会越来越快乐。四点一到，我就会坐立不安。我会让你看到我究竟有多快乐！但是如果你来的时间不固定，我就不知道该什么时候开始准备迎接你……我们应该遵循正确的仪式……”
“Those also are actions too often neglected,” said the fox. “They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.”	“这也是经常被人遗忘的行为，”狐狸说，“所谓仪式，就是使某一天不同于其他日子，使某一时刻不同于其他时刻。比如说，捉我的那些猎人们就有一个仪式。每逢周四，他们都和村里的姑娘们跳舞。因此，周四成为了一个多么美妙的日子啊！我可以外出散步，直到葡萄园边上。如果猎人们随便什么时候都跳舞，每天都如此，那我也就没有休息的时候了。”
“Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.”	“你再去看看那些玫瑰花吧。你一定会明白，你的那朵花为什么是天下独一无二的玫瑰了。然后再回到我的身边向我告别，那时我将赠予你一个秘密作为离别礼物。”
The little prince went away, to look again at the roses. “You are not at all like my rose,” he said. “As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world… ”	于是小王子就跑去看那些玫瑰花。“你们一点也不像我的那朵玫瑰花，”他说道，“对我而言，你们什么都不是。没有人驯养过你们，你们也没有驯养过别人。你们就像我第一次见到狐狸一样，它那时和其他成千上万的狐狸没什么区别。但是，现在它成为了我的朋友，现在它就是世界上独一无二的狐狸了……”
“Goodbye,” said the fox. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”	“再见，”狐狸回应道，“这就是我的秘密，它很简单：只有心灵才能洞察一切，事物的本质是肉眼无法看到的。”
“What is essential is invisible to the eye,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember…	“事物的本质是肉眼无法看到的，”小王子重复着这句话，要把它记在心间。
“Men have forgotten this truth,” said the fox. “But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose... ”	“人们已经忘记了这个真理，”狐狸说，“但是你千万不要忘记：你要对你驯服过的一切永远负责，你要对你的那朵玫瑰花负责……”
“I am responsible for my rose,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.	“我要对我的那朵玫瑰花负责……”小王子重复着这句话，要把它记在心间。
Over the past 20 years, I have watched the Lion King for more than a dozen of times.
	过去的20年里，《狮子王》这部电影我看过不下12遍。
When I first watched the movie, the scene of Mufasa's death made me – a six-year-old girl at that time – cry, and since then, I have always skipped that part. Later on, during my middle-school years, I liked the love story part a lot, and Simba and Nala were really a perfect couple in my heart. Every time I watched the movie, I felt differently.
	第一次看那部电影时，六岁的我在看到木法沙死的时候哭惨了，此后就一直跳过那一段。后来，在中学时代，我特别喜欢辛巴和娜娜的爱情戏码，觉得他们俩就是最完美的一对。每次看《狮子王》都有不同的感受。
Recently, I have watched the Lion King again. This time, what impressed me the most was the lifestyle of Pumbaa and Timon – they were ordinary and lived an ordinary life. Before joining Simba to regain his kingdom, all about their life were eating and singing. It seemed to me that probably the years with Pumbaa and Timon were the happiest time in Simba's life.
	最近，我又看了一遍《狮子王》。这一次，最触动我的是彭彭和丁满的生活方式：他们很平凡，也过着平凡的日子。在帮助辛巴夺回王位之前，他们的生活就是吃饭和歌唱。在我看来，大概辛巴一生最快乐的日子就是和彭彭丁满在一起的那段时间了吧。
To me, the best lesson that Pumbaa and Timon have taught us is that even though they know they are ordinary and their life is ordinary, they still love and enjoy it.
	我认为这便是彭彭和丁满教给我们最棒的一课——虽然他们知道自己很平凡、生活很平凡，但他们仍然热爱并享受着这样的生活。
In fact, in the real world, only quite a few people can accomplish great things and become extraordinary, and the rest of us will just live our ordinary life.
	事实上，在真实世界，能够成就不凡的人也就是凤毛麟角，剩下的我们中的大多数都只是过着平凡的生活。
A sentence in an article recommended by the Fair (WeChat Subscription) touched me: by hard work, ordinary people only fight for the right to continue their ordinary life in the ordinary world. It is cruel, but it is true (at least in my opinion).
	世相（微信公众号）推送的一篇文章中的一句话让我感触颇深：“平凡的人在平凡的世界里辛苦奋斗，只是为了追求继续平凡地活下去的权力。”听起来很残酷，但这确实是事实（至少我是这么想的）。
The best solution is to accept and enjoy it. I know it's hard but this is a part of growing up. I'm not saying that we should not be ambitious or have great dreams, after all, just as Vince Lombardi has said, "Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence". However, I just think we should get prepared if our great dreams would never come true.
	最佳的做法就是接受并且享受。我知道这很难，但这就是成长的一部分。并不是说我们不应该抱有雄心壮志，毕竟，正如文斯·隆巴迪所说，“我们无法做到完美，但追求完美能让我们变得很棒”。我只是觉得，万一梦想永远无法实现，我们应该为此做好准备。
I also had dreamt about becoming extraordinary at a young age, same as most of my fellow classmates in primary school. In the senior high school, I was no longer one of the top students, and then, for the very first time, I recognized that maybe I couldn’t be extraordinary.
	是的，小时候的我也曾梦想着做个伟大的人，就跟当时小学的大多数同学一样。到了高中，当我不再是成绩最好的学生之一时，我第一次意识到可能自己没有办法成就不凡。
Now, I'm well aware that I'm no more than an ordinary person but I'm happy with that. I went to an ordinary university and got my BA in English, then to another ordinary university and received my MA in translation and interpreting. Doing the editor's job, I now earn myself a life in Shanghai, such an expensive metropolitan city to live in (and I'm not a local girl).
	现在，我十分确定自己就是平凡人，但我乐于做一个平凡的人。我本科是在普通的大学念的英语专业，研究生在另一个普通的大学念口笔译。现在，作为一个小编，我在上海这样一个高消费的大城市过着自己的小日子(而我并不是本地人)。
I can't afford Michael Kors or Issey Miyake, but I have comfortable clothes which fit me well. I usually go out dinner with a couple of friends on weekends, not fancy or first class restaurants but sidewalk café or common restaurants where we know there are delicious food and nice service.
	我买不起MK或者三宅一生，但也有不少舒适且符合自己风格的衣服。我常常周末和朋友出去浪，不会去高级饭店，但会去一些普通的街边小餐馆，那里也有很美味的食物和很贴心的服务。
I consider this not the passive acceptance, but an optimistic attitude of turning "this is life" to "this is the life". But all in all, I still have dreams, just in case they would become true one day.
	我并不觉得这是一种被动的接受，我认为这是一种生活态度，一种把“唉，这就是生活”转换为“噢，这才是生活”的乐观态度。不过不管怎么说，我也还是有梦想的，因为万一实现了呢~
"I hope my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."	第二天吃过早饭的时候，班纳特先生对他的太太说：“我的好太太，我希望你今天的午饭准备得好一些，因为我预料今天一定有客人来。”
"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope my dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home."	“你指的是那一位客人，我的好老爷?我一些也不知道有谁要来，除非夏绿蒂·卢卡斯碰巧会来看我们，我觉得拿我们平常的饭餐招待她也够好了。我不相信她在家里经常吃得这么好。”
"The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger."	“我所说到的这位客人是位男宾，又是个生客。”
Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. -- "A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure. Why Jane -- you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. -- But -- good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill, this moment."	班纳特太太的眼睛闪亮了起来。“一位男宾又是一位生客!那准是彬格莱先生，没有错。──哦，吉英，你从来没出过半点儿风声，你这个狡猾的东西!──嘿，彬格莱先生要来，真叫我太高兴啦。可是──老天爷呀!运气真不好，今天连一点儿鱼也买不着。──丽迪雅宝贝儿，代我按一按铃。我要马上吩咐希尔一下。”
"It is not Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life."	她的丈夫连忙说：“并不是彬格莱先生要来；说起这位客人，我一生都没见过他。”
This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	这句话叫全家都吃了一惊。他的太太和五个女儿立刻迫切地追问他，使他颇为高兴。
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained. "About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."	拿他太太和女儿们的好奇心打趣了一阵以后，他便原原本本地说：“大约在一个月以前，我就收到了一封信，两星期以前我写了回信，因为我觉得这是件相当伤脑筋的事，得趁早留意。信是我的表侄柯林斯先生寄来的。我死了以后，这位表侄可以高兴什么时候把你们撵出这所屋子，就什么时候撵出去。”
"Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it."	“噢，天啊，”他的太太叫起来了。“听你提起这件事我就受不了。请你别谈那个讨厌的家伙吧。你自己的产业不能让自己的孩子继承，却要让别人来继承，这是世界上最难堪的事。如果我是你，一定早就想出办法来补救这个问题啦。”
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.	吉英和伊丽莎白设法把继承权的问题跟她解释了一下。其实她们一直没法跟她解释，可是这个问题跟她是讲不明白的。她老是破口大骂，说是自己的产业不能由五个亲生女儿继承，却白白送给一个和她们毫不相干的人，这实在是太不合情理。
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself."	“这的确是一最不公道的事，”班纳特先生说，“柯林斯先生要继承浪博恩的产业，他这桩罪过是洗也洗不清的。不过，要是你听听他这封信里所说的话，那你就会心肠软一些，因为他这番表明心迹还算不错。”
"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?"	“不，我相信我绝对不会心软下来；我觉得他写信给你真是既没有礼貌，又非常虚伪。我恨这种虚伪的朋友。他为什么不象他的爸爸那样跟你吵得不可开交呢？”
"Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear."	“哦，真的，他对这个问题，好象也有些为了顾全孝道，犹豫不决，且让我把信读给你们听吧：
"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peacemaking gentleman," said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. "He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again."	“那么，四点钟的时候，这位息事宁人的先生就要来啦，”班纳特先生一边把信折好，一边说。“他倒是个很有良心、很有礼貌的青年，一定是的；我相信他一定会成为一个值得器重的朋友，只要咖苔琳夫人能够开开恩，让他以后再上我们这儿来，那更好啦。”
"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him."	“他讲到我们女儿们的那几句话，倒还说得不错;要是他果真打算设法补偿，我倒不反对。”
"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit."	吉英说：“他说要给我们补偿，我们虽然猜不出他究竟是什么意思，可是他这一片好意也的确难得。”
Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.	伊丽莎白听到他对咖苔琳夫人尊敬得那么出奇，而且他竟那么好心好意，随时替他自己教区里的居民行洗礼，主持婚礼和丧礼，不觉大为吃惊。
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she. "I cannot make him out. -- There is something very pompous in his stile. -- And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail? -- We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could. -- Can he be a sensible man, sir?"	“我看他一定是个古怪人，”她说。“我真弄不懂他。他的文笔似乎有些浮夸。他所谓因为继承了我们的产权而感到万分抱歉，这话是什么意思呢?即使这件事可以取消，我们也不要以为他就肯取消，他是个头脑清楚的人吗，爸爸？”
"No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him."	“不，宝贝，我想他不会是的。我完全认为他是恰恰相反。从他信里那种既谦卑又自大的口气上就可以看得出来。我倒真想见见他。”
"In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed."	曼丽说：“就文章而论，他的信倒好象写得没有什么毛病。橄榄枝这种说法虽然并不新颖，可是我觉得用得倒很恰当。”
To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.	在咖苔琳和丽迪雅看来，无论是那封信也好，写信的人也好，都没有一点儿意思。反正她们觉得她们的表兄绝不会穿着“红制服”来，而这几个星期以来，穿其他任何颜色的衣服的人，她们都不乐意结交。至于她们的母亲，原来的一般怨气已经被柯林斯先生一封信打消了不少，她倒准备相当平心静气地会见他，这使得她的丈夫和女儿们都觉得非常奇怪。
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet, indeed, said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but Mrs. Bennet who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,	柯林斯先生准时来了，全家都非常客气地接待他，班纳特先生简直没有说什么话；可是太太和几位小姐都十分愿意畅谈一下，而柯林斯先生本人好象既不需要人家鼓励他多说话，也不打算不说话。他是个二十五岁的青年，高高的个儿，望上去很肥胖，他的气派端庄而堂皇，又很拘泥礼节。他刚一坐下来就恭维班纳特太太福气好，养了这么多好女儿，他说，早就听到人们对她们美貌赞扬备至，今天一见面，才知道她们的美貌远远超过了她们的名声;他又说，他相信小姐们到时候都会结下美满良缘。他这些奉承话，人家真不大爱听，只有班纳特太太，没有哪句恭维话听不下去，于是极其干脆地回答道：
"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly."	“我相信你是个好心肠的人，先生；我一心希望能如你的金口，否则她们就不堪设想了。事情实在摆布得太古怪啦。”
"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things, I know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed."	“唉，先生，我的确是说到这方面。你得承认，这对于我可怜的女儿们真是件不幸的事。我并不想怪你，因为我也知道，世界上这一类的事完全靠命运。一个人的产业一旦要限定继承人，那你就无从知道它会落到谁的手里去。”
"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, -- and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted --"	“太太，我深深知道，这件事苦了表妹们，我在这个问题上有很多意见，一时却不敢莽撞冒失。可是我可以向年轻的小姐们保证，我上这儿来，就是为了要向她们表示我的敬慕。目前我也不打算多说，或许等到将来我们相处得更熟一些的时候──”
He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The dinner too, in its turn, was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.	主人家请他吃午饭了，于是他的话不得不被打断。小姐们彼此相视而笑。柯林斯先生所爱慕的才不光光是她们呢。他把客厅、饭厅、以及屋子里所有的家具，都仔细看了一遍，赞美了一番。班纳特太太本当听到他赞美一句，心里就得意一阵，怎奈她也想到，他原来是把这些东西都看作他自己未来的财产，因此她又非常难受。连一顿午饭也蒙他称赏不置，他请求主人告诉他，究竟是哪位表妹烧得这一手好菜。班纳特太太听到他这句话，不禁把他指责了一番。她相当不客气地跟他说，她们家里现在还雇得起一个象样的厨子，根本用不到女儿们过问厨房里的事。他请求她原谅，不要见怪。于是她用柔和的声调说，她根本没有怪他，可是他却接接连连地道歉了一刻钟之久。
Books inspire me and have always been my refuge to conflicts in life. Here are the 6 books that challenged my perspectives and wiped of my stringent notions.	书籍给我灵感，在生活中遇到冲突矛盾时书籍是我最好的避难所。以下6本书挑战我的人生观，颠覆了我故有严苛的理念。
Simply, buy this book for the path towards enlightenment in a spiritual way that encapsulates your personal growth. This book never gives you easy solutions to the conflicts, it simply says: “Legitimate suffering is part of life” and leaves you with better insights to lead a fulfilled life.	简单地说，这本书封装了你的心智成熟的旅程，让你从精神层面得到进步的启发。这本书从不轻易告诉你面对冲突时的解决办法。它只是简单告诉你：“痛苦是人生必不可少的部分”，你所需要做的就是以更好的心态洞悉世事，赢取充实的人生。
2. The Go-Giver by Bob Burg and John David Mann《	做一个积极的付出者》 鲍勃·伯格、约翰·大卫·曼著
I didn’t even expect that such a small book could make a huge difference in my approach towards life. It simply says, “Give” and go on explaining 5 profound laws that directs the mankind and concludes that there is always a truth in the opposite.	我甚至从未期望这样一本小小的书能使我对待生活的态度得到巨大改变。书中主要阐述了“付出”，同时解析了5大指引人类的定律（终极成功五大定律”：价值定律、收入定律、影响力定律、真实定律和收获定律），结论是在每个真理背后都有一个相反的定律。
Tao Te Ching is one of the finest books on philosophy written by Lao Tzu, a Chinese philosopher and a poet. It’s profound, intriguing and soul stirring. Read it and get in touch with the enlightening insights that give you enough thrills to pursue your life vigorously.《	道德经》是由中国的哲学家、诗人老子所著，可谓是哲学界最经典的著作之一。其内容深刻、有趣且令人深思。阅读此书、从中获得启发，这些思想会使你在积极追求人生的过程中体验足够的快感。
I never knew habits play such an important role in shaping our future until I read this book. It simply says, you are what your habits are, and also suggests the proven techniques to generate new habits that alter our lifestyle and eventually our life. A must read for everyone to understand the intricacies of the habits.	在翻开这本书之前，我从未想过习惯在塑造我们的未来方面竟然起着如此重要的作用。书中仅仅说：你的习惯就是你本身所在，它提出行之有效的方法来帮人们塑造新的习惯，改变我们的生活方式，最终改变我们的生活。如果想要了解错综复杂的习惯的力量，这是一本必看的书。
Myths – clues to the spiritual potentialities of human life; this was a revelation.	神话——人类生活精神层面的潜能体现；这是一种启示。
The Power of Myth is a book based on the conversations between mythologist Joseph Campbell and journalist Bill Moyers. Believe me, it is such an astounding book that gives you a thorough understanding of the intriguing elements of life such as life, death, love, marriage etc. and leaves you spellbound.《	神话的力量》是基于神话学家约瑟夫·坎贝尔和记者比尔·莫耶斯之间对话的书。相信我，这是一本惊人的书，让你透彻地理解生活众多部分：如生命，死亡，爱情，婚姻等，令你为之着迷。
I have my own misconceptions of getting rich till I read this book. All were cleared off and made a huge difference in my life after knowing some of the secrets mentioned in this book. Read it, for it teaches you to become rich, notinstantaneously but strategically.	在读到这本书之前我对致富有着误解。但当读了这本书后，书中提到的部分秘密让我的理念大为改观，并使我的生活产生了巨大的变化。阅读它吧，因为它会教你如何致富，不是立竿见影的，但却是有策略性的。
Note: The points mentioned here are just the bits of insights I gained from the above books and I’m sure you would find much more insights. Go ahead and grab them, you will never regret.	注：上面提到的关于这些书的观点只是基于我个人心得，我相信你读了后会有更深层的洞悉。去吧，抓起一本阅读，你绝对不会后悔。
       IN consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive hem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added that, if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. -- Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved -- nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.       	班纳特姐妹俩商量妥当了以后，伊丽莎白第二天早上就写信给她母亲，请她当天就派车子来接她们。可是，班纳特太太早就打算让她两个女儿在尼日斐花园待到下星期二，以便让吉英正好住满一个星期，因此不大乐意提前接她们回家，回信也写得使她们不太满意，至少使伊丽莎白不十分满意，因为她急于要回家。班纳特太太信上说，非到星期二，家里弄不出马车来。她写完信之后，又补写了几句，说是倘若彬格莱先生兄妹挽留她们多待几天，她非常愿意让她们待下去。怎奈伊丽莎白就是不肯待下去，她打定主意非回家不可──也不怎么指望主人家挽留她们，她反而怕人家以为她们赖在那儿不肯走。于是她催促吉英马上去向彬格莱借马车。她们最后决定向主人家说明，她们当天上午就要离开尼日斐花园，而且把借马车的事也提出来。
      The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day, to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her -- that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.      	主人家听到这话，表示百般关切，便再三挽留她们，希望她们至少待到下一天再走，吉英让她们说服了，于是姐妹俩只得再耽搁一天。这一下可叫彬格莱小姐后悔挽留她们，她对伊丽莎白又嫉妒又讨厌，因此也就顾不得对吉英的感情了。彬格莱听到她们马上要走非常发愁，便一遍又一遍劝导吉英，说她还没有完全复元，马上就走不大妥当，可是吉英既然觉得自己的主张是对的便再三坚持。
      To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence -- Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked -- and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her, and more teazing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.      	不过达西却觉得这是个好消息，他认为伊丽莎白在尼日斐花园待得够久了。他没想到这次会给她弄得这般地心醉，加上彬格莱小姐一方面对她没礼貌，另方面又越发拿他自己开玩笑。他灵机一动，决定叫自己特别当心些，目前决不要流露出对她有什么爱慕的意思——一点儿形迹也不要流露出来，免得她存非份之想，就此要操纵我达西的终身幸福。他感觉到，假如她存了那种心，那么一定是他昨天对待她的态度起了举足轻重的作用——叫她不是对他更有好感，便是把他完全厌弃。他这样拿定了主意，于是星期六一整天简直没有跟她说上十句话。虽然他那天曾经有一次跟她单独在一起待了半小时之久，他却正大光明地用心看书，看也没看她一眼。
      On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. -- Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.        	星期日做过晨祷以后，班家两姐妹立即告辞，主人家几乎人人乐意。彬格莱小姐对伊丽莎白一下子变得有礼貌起来了，对吉英也一下子变得亲热了。分手的时候，她先跟吉英说，非常盼望以后有机会在浪博恩或者在尼日斐花园跟她重逢，接着又十分亲切地拥抱了她一番，甚至还跟伊丽莎白握了握手。伊丽莎白高高兴兴地告别了大家。
      They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. -- But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.      	到家以后，母亲并不怎么热诚地欢迎她们。班纳特太太奇怪她们俩怎么竟会提前回来，非常埋怨她们给家里招来那么多麻烦，说是吉英十拿九稳地又要伤风了。倒是她们的父亲，看到两个女儿回家来了，嘴上虽然没有说什么欢天喜地的话，心里确实非常高兴。他早就体会到，这两个女儿在家里的地位多么重要。晚上一家人聚在一起聊天的时候，要是吉英和伊丽莎白不在场，就没有劲，甚至毫无意义。
      They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.      	她们发觉曼丽还象以往一样，在埋头研究和声学以及人性的问题，她拿出了一些新的札记给她们欣赏，又发表一些对旧道德的新见解给她们听。咖苔琳和丽迪雅也告诉了她们一些新闻，可是性质完全不同。据她们说，民兵团自从上星期三以来又出了好多事，添了好多传说；有几个军官新近跟她们的姨爹吃过饭；一个士兵挨了鞭打，又听说弗斯脱上校的确快结婚了。
The more books you read, the better your life will be. If you don’t believe me, please consider these twelve compelling reasons to read more books.	你读的书越多，你的生活就会越好。如果你不相信我的话，请考虑这十二个令人信服的理由多读书。
This shouldn’t come as a shock, but studies suggest reading makes you smart. Unlike watching television, which requires no thought process, reading is an active learning experience that will keep your mind sharp (even in old age).	这条理由应该在大家意料之中：研究表明阅读使人变聪明。读书不像看电视，看电视不需要有思维活动过程，阅读是一个积极的学习体验，会让你的思维保持敏捷（即使到了老年思维也能保持敏捷）。
The more books you read, the more knowledge you will have, the more strategies and resources your brain will store, the more likely you will succeed.	你读的书越多，你的知识就会越多，你的大脑中会存储的策略和资源就越多，你就越有可能成功。
Sometimes our daily life can start to feel dull, dry or depressing — I know it, you know it, we all know it. At times like this, I like to dive into a good fiction book for a much-needed escape into another world, where I can forget about whatever problems are stressing me out. Whether you want to travel to the land of the Hobbits, a galaxy far away or a tropical destination in a steamy romance novel is up to you. You’ll come back refreshed after your mini-vacation to a fresh and exciting place in the world of words.	有时候我们在日常生活中感到枯燥、乏味或忧郁，我懂的、你懂的、我们都懂的。遇到这样的时候，我喜欢一头扎进好看的小说书中，我急需逃到另一个世界中，在那里我可以忘记任何让我感到有压力的问题。不论你是想前往霍比特人的土地上体验一下，还是想畅游在一个很遥远的星系，或是去往爱情小说中的热带胜地，都取决于你自己。在书中世界的某个让你感到兴奋的新鲜地方度过一个迷你假期，等你回来后，你会让自己的身心焕然一新。
The more words you’re capable of using, the better you will become at expressing your thoughts and feelings. I couldn’t imagine how I would write articles like this if I didn’t actively aim to expand my vocabulary, because using the same few words to express myself would get awfully boring in a hurry (don’t you agree?).	你运用的单词越多，你就越能更好地表达你的想法和感受。如果我没有积极地想去扩充我的词汇量，真想不到我会写出这么好的文章，因为总用那几句话来表达自己，势必会了无新意非常枯燥乏味。（你也这么认为吧？）
Reading more books will enable you to say the sentence, “Did you know ________?” more often, making it easier to start conversations with strangers (or, as I like to say, “People who aren’t my friends yet”).	多阅读书籍会让你说这句话，“你知道____ 吗？” 以这样的方式开始与陌生人对话比较容易（或者我会说，“那些还不是我朋友的人”）。
If you’re looking for entertainment on a budget, you can’t beat books. Thanks to the popularity of electronic reading devices like the Kindle and re-selling websites like eBay, it’s never been easier to entertain yourself for hours at a time, for the low cost of a few dollars.	如果你还想花钱找乐子但又预算有限，那么看书就是无敌的自娱自乐方式。由于电子阅读设备的普及，像Kindle和像eBay等转售阅读网站非常方便，借助它们每次你都能轻松自娱自乐数小时之久，成本不过几美元而已。
7. You will discover surprising new ideas that are interesting and engaging	多读书你会发掘出自己惊人的、有趣的、很棒的新想法
Reading introduced me to concepts like mindful eating, relaxation exercises, and the importance of loving yourself. If I didn’t read, I wouldn’t even be aware of these ideas, which have defined my entire coaching philosophy. If you don’t read, you could be missing out on intriguing ideas that would likewise re-define your personal purpose or business philosophy.	阅读使我形成这些概念：用心饮食、放松锻炼和爱自己的重要性。如果我不读书，我甚至不会意识到这些想法，它重新定义了我的整个人生指导哲学。如果你不读书，你也许就不会发掘出自己的一些有趣想法，这些想法则能重新定义你的个人目标和职业哲学。
Have you ever found yourself stuck in a waiting room, bored out of your mind, with nothing to read but gossip magazines? If so, you should know that it is wise to keep a book in your purse or car at all times, as you never know when you’ll find yourself with some time to kill. Even if you just take a few minutes to read a chapter during your commute and lunch break every day, those minutes will quickly turn into hours if repeated consistently.	你一定有过等在候诊室无事可做的时候，感觉很无聊死了，除了翻看八卦杂志就没什么可阅读的好书？如果你遇到过这样的情况，你就会知道在你的包里或车里始终放一本书是多么明智的选择，你永远都无法预知自己什么时候会遇到需要消磨时间的情况。即使你每天只是在上下班的车上或者午休时间都可以用几分钟的时间读一章内容，坚持几分钟几分钟地累计，很快阅读时间就累计成数小时。
We live in a society that expects instant gratification, which is anything but a blessing for most people’s success in life, as there is nothing “quick” or “easy” about losing weight or starting a successful business. While it might be “easier” to watch a two-hour movie, it is far more beneficial to spend forty-eight hours reading a book. Opting for the book over the TV will strengthen your patience muscles over time, resulting in more success in business and life.	我们生活在一个期望即时满足的社会，对大多数人成功生活而言，我们只能祝福了：因为对于减肥或成功开始一份事业，并没有什么“快速” 或“容易” 的路途可走。虽然看两小时的电影可能会比较“容易”，但花48个小时阅读一本书却有益得多。选择阅读而不是看电视，随着时间的推移这会增强你的“耐力肌肉”，结果工作和生活都会取得比较大的成功。
Don’t you think reading academic journals, articles, and books by experts in your field might make you better at what you do? If you can’t be bothered to learn more about your profession, then your lack of passion could be a sign that you’re in the wrong field.	你不觉得阅读你的领域的专家们所著的学术期刊、文章和书籍，可能会使你在自己的领域上做的更好吗？如果对于你自己的职业你不愿意多学习，那么可能代表你对自己这个职业缺少激情，你自己选错了职业领域。
Exposing yourself to artificial light on your cellphone, TV or tablet reduces your body’s production of melatonin, which can make it difficult to get a good night’s sleep, if you do so late at night. You would be wise to cut off all electronics at least an hour before bed, and replace that with a good book, which is a much better sleep-friendly alternative.	你总是处在手机、电视或平板电脑这类人造光的环境下，会造成身体褪黑激素量降低，这样就很难睡个好觉，尤其是如果你晚上睡得那么晚。明智的选择是：至少在睡觉前一个小时，切断所有电器，换成一本好书，这是一种更加睡眠友好的选择。
I firmly believe that if it wasn’t for books, I wouldn’t have achieved an awful lot in my life; nor would I have the knowledge, imagination or creativity that I depend on as a writer, business owner, and coach. I hope these reasons to read more books encourage you to unlock your potential with the power of reading.	我坚信在我的生活中，如果不多读书的话，我不会有今天的收获和成就，我也没有知识、想象力或创造力从事作家、企业主和教练这些职业。我希望这些理由能鼓励你多读书，开发你在阅读力量上的潜能。
    WHEN the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and, seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.
	女士们吃过晚饭以后，伊丽莎白就上楼到她姐姐那儿去，看她穿戴得妥妥贴贴，不会着凉，便陪着她上客厅去。她的女朋友们见到她，都表示欢迎，一个个都说非常高兴。在男客们没有来的那一个钟头里，她们是那么和蔼可亲，伊丽莎白从来不曾看到过。她们的健谈本领真是吓人，描述起宴会来纤毫入微，说起故事来风趣横溢，讥笑起一个朋友来也是有声有色。
　　But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object. Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.
　　	可是男客们一走进来，吉英就不怎么引人注目了。达西一进门，彬格莱小姐的眼睛就立刻转到他身上去，要跟他说话。达西首先向班纳特小姐问好，客客气气地祝贺她病休复元；赫斯脱先生也对她微微一鞠躬，说是见到她“非常高兴”；但是说到词气周到，情意恳切，可就比不上彬格莱先生那几声问候。彬格莱先生才算得上情深意切，满怀欢欣。开头半小时完全消磨在添煤上面，生怕屋子里冷起来会叫病人受不了。吉英依照彬格莱的话，移坐到火炉的另一边去，那样她就离开门口远一些，免得受凉。接着他自己在她身旁坐下，一心跟她说话，简直不理睬别人。伊丽莎白正在对面角落里做活计，把这全部情景都看在眼里，感到无限高兴。
　　When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table -- but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.
　　	喝过茶以后，赫斯脱先生提醒她的小姨子把牌桌摆好，可是没有用。她早就看出达西先生不想打牌，因此赫斯脱先生后来公开提出要打牌也被她拒绝了。她跟他说，谁也不想玩牌，只见全场对这件事都不作声，看来她的确没有说错。因此，赫斯脱先生无事可做，只得躺在沙发上打瞌睡。达西拿起一本书来。彬格莱小姐也拿起一本书来。赫斯脱太太聚精会神地在玩弄自己的手镯和指环，偶而也在她弟弟跟班纳特小姐的对话中插几句嘴。
　　Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! -- When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library."
　　	彬格莱小姐一面看达西读书，一面自己读书，两件事同时并做，都是半心半意。她老是向他问句什么的，或者是看他读到哪一页。不过，她总是没有办法逗她说话；她问一句他就答一句，答过以后便继续读他的书。彬格莱小姐所以要挑选那一本书读，只不过因为那是达西所读的第二卷，她满想读个津津有味，不料这会儿倒读得精疲力尽了。她打了个呵欠，说道：“这样度过一个晚上，真是多么愉快啊！我说呀，什么娱乐也抵不上读书的乐趣。无论干什么事，都是一上手就要厌倦，读书却不会这样！将来有一天我自己有了家，要是没有个很好的书房，那会多遗憾哟。”
　　No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,
　　	谁也没有理睬她。于是她又打了个呵欠，抛开书本，把整个房间里望了一转，要想找点儿什么东西消遗消遗，这时忽听得她哥哥跟班纳特小姐说要开一次跳舞会，她就猛可地掉过头来对他说：
　　"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? -- I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."
    	“这样说，查尔斯，你真打算在尼日斐花园开一次跳舞会吗？我劝你最好还是先征求一下在场朋友们的意见再作决定吧。这里面就会有人觉得跳舞是受罪，而不是娱乐，要是没有这种人，你怪我好了。”
　　"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins -- but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards."
    	“如果你指的是达西，”她的哥哥大声说，“那么，他可以在跳舞开始以前就上床去睡觉，随他的便好啦。舞会已经决定了非开不可，只等尼可尔斯把一切都准备好了，我就下请贴。”
　　"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day."
    	彬格莱小姐说：“要是开舞会能换些花样，那我就更高兴了，通常舞会上的那老一套，实在讨厌透顶。你如果能把那一天的日程改一改，用谈话来代替跳舞，那一定有意思得多。”
　　"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."　
　　	“也许有意思得多，珈罗琳，可是那还象什么舞会呢。”　
　　Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; -- but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and turning to Elizabeth, said,
    	彬格莱小姐没有回答。不大一会儿工夫，她就站起身来，在房间里踱来踱去，故意在达西面前卖弄她优美的体态和矫健的步伐，只可惜达西只顾在那里一心一意地看书，因此她只落得枉费心机。她绝望之余，决定再作一次努力，于是转过身来对伊丽莎白说：
　　"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. -- I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."
　　	“伊丽莎·班纳特小姐，我劝你还是学学我的样子，在房间里瞎走动走动吧。告诉你，坐了那么久，走动一下可以提提精神。”
　　Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. "What could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning" -- and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?
　　	伊丽莎白觉得很诧异，可是立刻依了她的意思。于是彬格莱小姐献殷勤的真正目的达到了──达西先生果然抬起头来，原来达西也和伊丽莎白一样，看出了她在耍花招引人注目，便不知不觉地放下了书本。两位小姐立刻请他来一块儿踱步，可是他谢绝了，说是她们俩所以要在屋子里踱来踱去，据他的想象，无非有两个动机，如果他参加她们一起散步，对于她们的任何一个动机都会有妨碍。他这话是什么意思？彬格莱小姐极想知道他讲这话用意何在，便问伊丽莎白懂不懂。
　　"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it."
    	伊丽莎白回答道：“根本不懂，他一定是存心刁难我们，不过你最好不要理睬他，让他失望一下。”
　　Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.
　　	可惜彬格莱小姐遇到任何事情都不忍心叫达西先生失望，于是再三要求他非把他的所谓两个动机解释一下不可。
　　"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. "You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; -- if the first, I should be completely in your way; -- and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire."
　　	达西等她一住口，便马上说：“我非常愿意解释一下，事情不外乎是这样的，你们是心腹之交，所以选择了这个办法来消磨黄昏，还要谈谈私事，否则就是你们自以为散起步来体态显得特别好看，所以要散散步。倘若是出于第一个动机，我夹在你们一起就会妨碍你们;假若是出于第二个动机，那么我坐在火炉旁边可以更好地欣赏你们。”
　　"Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley. "I never heard any thing so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?"
    	“噢，吓坏人！”彬格莱小姐叫起来了。“我从来没听到过这么毒辣的话。──亏他说得出，该怎么罚他呀？”
　　"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth. "We can all plague and punish one another. Teaze him -- laugh at him. -- Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."
　　	“要是你存心罚他，那是再容易不过的事，”伊丽莎白说。“彼此都可以罚来罚去，折磨来折磨去。作弄他一番吧──讥笑他一番吧。你们既然这么相熟，你该懂得怎么对付他呀。”
　　"But upon my honour I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that. Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no -- I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself."
　　	“天地良心，我不懂得。不瞒你说，我们虽然相熟，可是要懂得怎样来对付他，不差得远呢。想要对付这种性格冷静和头脑机灵的人，可不容易！不行，不行，我想我们是搞不过他的。至于讥笑他，说句你不生气的话，我们可不能凭空笑人家，弄得反而惹人笑话。让达西先生去自鸣得意吧。”
　　"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth. "That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a laugh."
    	“原来达西先生是不能让人笑话的！”伊丽莎白嚷道。“这种优越的条件倒真少有，我希望一直不要多，这样的朋友多了，我的损失可大啦。我特别喜欢笑话。“
　　"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be. The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke."
　　	“彬格莱小姐过奖我啦。”他说。“要是一个人把开玩笑当作人生最重要的事，那么，最聪明最优秀的人──不，最聪明最优秀的行为──也就会变得可笑了。”
　　"Certainly," replied Elizabeth -- "there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. -- But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without."
　　	“那当然罗，”伊丽莎白回答道，“这样的人的确有，可是我希望我自己不在其内。我希望我怎么样也不会讥笑聪明的行为或者是良好的行为。愚蠢和无聊，荒唐和矛盾，这的确叫我觉得好笑，我自己也承认，我只要能够加以讥笑，总是加以讥笑。不过我觉得这些弱点正是你身上所没有的。”
　　"perhaps that is not possible for any one. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule."
    	“或许谁都还会有这些弱点，否则可真糟了，绝顶的聪慧也要招人嘲笑了。我一生都在研究该怎么样避免这些弱点。”
　　"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride -- where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."
    	“不错，虚荣的确是个弱点。可是傲慢──只要你果真聪明过人──你就会傲慢得比较有分寸。”
　　"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley; -- "and pray what is the result?"
    	“你考问达西先生考问好了吧，我想，”彬格莱小姐说。“请问结论如何？”
　　"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it himself without disguise."
　　	“我完全承认达西先生没有一些缺点。他自己也承认了这一点，并没有掩饰。”
　　"No" -- said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. -- It is I believe too little yielding -- certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. -- My good opinion once lost is lost for ever."
　　	“不，”达西说，“我并没有说过这种装场面的话。我有够多的毛病，不过这些毛病与头脑并没有关系。至于我的性格，我可不敢自夸。我认为我的性格太不能委曲求全，这当然是说我在处世方面太不能委曲求全地随和别人。别人的愚蠢和过错我本应该赶快忘掉，却偏偏忘不掉;人家得罪了我，我也忘不掉。说到我的一些情绪，也并不是我一打算把它们去除掉，它们就会烟消云散。我的脾气可以说是够叫人厌恶的。我对于某个人一旦没有了好感，就永远没有好感。”
　　"That is a failing indeed!" -- cried Elizabeth. "Implacable resentment is a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. -- I really cannot laugh at it; you are safe from me."
    	“这倒的的确确是个大缺点！”伊丽莎白大声说道。“跟人家怨恨不解，的确是性格上的一个阴影可是你对于自己的缺点，已经挑剔得很严格。我的确不能再讥笑你了。你放心好啦。”
　　"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."
　　	“我，相信一个人不管是怎样的脾气，都免不了有某种短处，这是一种天生的缺陷，即使受教育受得再好，也还是克服不了。”
    "And your defect is a propensity to hate every body."
　　	“你有一种倾向，──对什么人都感到厌恶，这就是你的缺陷。”
　　"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand them."
    	“而你的缺陷呢，”达西笑着回答。“就是故意去误解别人。”
　　"Do let us have a little music," -- cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. -- "Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst."
    	彬格莱小姐眼见这场谈话没有她的份，不禁有些厌倦，便大声说道：“让我们来听听音乐吧，露薏莎，你不怕我吵醒赫斯脱先生吗？”
　　Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.
　　	她的姐姐毫不反对，于是钢琴便打开了。达西想了一下，觉得这样也不错。他开始感觉到对伊丽莎白似乎已经过分亲近了一些。
　　THE day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room. The loo table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.　　	这一天过得和前一天没有多大的不同。赫斯脱太太和彬格莱小姐上午陪了病人几个钟头，病人尽管好转得很慢，却在不断地好转。晚上，伊丽莎白跟她们一块儿待在客厅里。不过这一回却没有看见有人打“禄牌”。达西先生在写信，彬格莱小姐坐在他身旁看他写，一再纠缠不清地要他代她附笔问候他的妹妹。赫斯脱先生和彬格莱先生在打“皮克牌”，赫斯脱太太在一旁看他们打。
　　Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.　　	伊丽莎白在做针线，一面留神地听着达西跟彬格莱小姐谈话。只听得彬格莱小姐恭维话说个不停，不是说他的字写得好，就是说他的字迹一行行很齐整，要不就是赞美他的信写得仔细，可是对方却完全是冷冰冰爱理不理。这两个人你问我答，形成了一段奇妙的对白。照这样看来，伊丽莎白的确没有把他们俩看错。
　　"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"　　	“达西小姐收到了这样的一封信，将会怎样高兴啊！”
　　"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!"　　	“你一年里头得写多少封信啊。还得写事务上的信，我看这是够厌烦的吧！”
　　"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."　　	“这么说，这些信总算幸亏碰到了我，没有碰到你。”
　　"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well."　　	“我怕你那支笔不大管用了吧。让我来代你修理修理。修笔真是我的拿手好戏。”
　　"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's."　　	“请告诉令妹，就说我听到她的竖琴弹得进步了。真觉得高兴，还请你告诉她说，她寄来给我装饰桌子的那张美丽的小图案，我真喜欢极了，我觉得比起格兰特小姐的那张真好得太多了。”
　　"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? -- At present I have not room to do them justice."　　	“可否请你通融一下，让我把你的喜欢，延迟到下一次写信时再告诉她？这一次我可写不下这么多啦。”
　　"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?"　　	“噢，不要紧。正月里我就可以跟她见面。不过，你老是写那么动人的长信给她吗，达西先生？”
　　"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine."　　	“我的信一般都写得很长；不过是否每封信都写得动人，那可不能由我自己来说了。”
　　"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill."　　	“不过我总觉得，凡是写起长信来一挥而就的人，无论如何也不会写得不好。”
　　"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother -- "because he does not write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. -- Do not you, Darcy?"　　	她的哥哥嚷道：“这种恭维话可不能用在达西身上，珈罗琳，因为他并不能够大笔一挥而就，他还得在四个音节的字上面多多推敲。──达西，你可不是这样吗？”
　　"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."　　	“噢，”彬格莱小姐叫起来了，“查尔斯写起信来，那种潦草随便的态度，简直不可想象。他要漏掉一半字，涂掉一半字。”
　　"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them -- by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."　　	“我念头转得太快，简直来有及写，因此有时候收信人读到我的信，反而觉得言之无物。”
　　"Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."　　	“彬格莱先生，”伊丽莎白说，“你这样谦虚，真叫人家本来要责备你也不好意思责备了。”
　　"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."　　	达西说：“假装谦虚偏偏往往就是信口开河，有时候简直是转弯抹角的自夸？”
　　"And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?"　　	“那么，我刚刚那几句谦虚的话，究竟是信口开河呢，还是转弯抹角的自夸？”
　　"The indirect boast; -- for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself -- and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"　　	“要算是转弯抹角的自夸，因为你对于你自己写信方面的缺点觉得很得意，你认为你思想敏捷，懒得去注意书法，而且你认为你这些方面即使没有什么了不起，完全不考虑到做出来的成绩是不是完美。你今天早上跟班纳特太太说，如果你决定要从尼日斐花园搬走，你五分钟之内就可以搬走，这种话无非是夸耀自己，恭维自己。再说，急躁的结果只会使得应该要做好的事情没有做好，无论对人对已，都没有真正的好处，这有什么值得赞美的呢？”
　　"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."　　	“得了吧，”彬格莱先生嚷道，“晚上还记起早上的事，真是太不值得。而且老实说，我相信我对于自己的看法并没有错，我到现在还相信没有错。因此，我至少不是故意要显得那么神速，想要在小姐们面前炫耀自己。”
　　"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, "Bingley, you had better stay till next week," you would probably do it, you would probably not go -- and, at another word, might stay a month."　　	“也许你真的相信你自己的话；可是我怎么也不相信你做事情会那么当机立断。我知道你也跟一般人一样，都是见机行事。譬如你正跨上马要走了，忽然有朋友跟你说：‘彬格莱，你最好还是待到下个星期再走吧。’那你可能就会听他的话，可能就不走了，要是他再跟你说句什么的，你也许就会再待上一个月。”
　　"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself."　　	伊丽莎白叫道：“你这一番话只不过说明了彬格莱先生并没有任着他自己的性子说做就做。你这样一说，比他自己说更来得光彩啦。”
　　"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could."　　	彬格莱说：“我真太高兴了，我的朋友所说的话，经你这么一圆转，反面变成恭维我的话了。不过，我只怕你这种圆转并不投合那位先生的本意，因为：我如果真遇到这种事，我会爽爽快快地谢绝那位朋友，骑上马就走，那他一定更看得起我。”
　　"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"　　	“那么，难道达西先生认为，不管你本来的打算是多么轻率卤莽，只要你一打定主意就坚持到底，也就情有可原了吗？”
　　"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself."　　	“老实说，我也解释不清楚；那得由达西自己来说明。”
　　"You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety."　　	“你想要把这些意见说成我的意见，我可从来没承认过。不过，班纳特小姐，即使把你所说的这种种情形假定为真有其事，你可别忘了这一点：那个朋友固然叫他回到屋子里去叫他不要那么说做就做，可是那也不过是那位朋友有那么一种希望，对他提出那么一个要求，可并没有坚持要他非那样做不可。”
　　"To yield readily -- easily -- to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you."　　	“说到随随便便地轻易听从一个朋友的劝告，在你身上可还找不出这个优点。”
　　"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either."　　	“如果不问是非，随随便便就听从，恐怕对于两个人全不能算是一种恭维吧。”
　　"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"　　	“达西先生，我觉得你未免否定了友谊和感情对于一个人的影响。要知道，一个人如果尊重别人提出的要求，通常都是用不着说服就会心甘情愿地听从的。我并不是因为你说到彬格莱先生而就借题发挥。也许我们可以等到真有这种事情发生的时候，再来讨论他处理得是不适当。不过一般说来，朋友与朋友相处，遇到一件无关紧要的事情的时候，一个已经打定主意，另一个要他改变一下主意，如果被要求的人不等到到对方加以说服，就听众了对方的意见，你能说他有什么不是吗？”
　　"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"　　	“我们且慢讨论这个问题，不妨先仔仔细细研究一下，那个朋友提出的要求究竟重要到什么程度，他们两个人的交情又深到什么程度，这样好不好？”
　　"By all means," cried Bingley; "Let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do."　　	彬格莱大声说道：“好极了，请你仔仔细细讲吧，连到他们的身材的高矮和大小也别忘了讲，因为，班纳特小姐，你一定想象不到讨论起问题来的时候这一点是多么重要。老实对你说，要是达西先生不比我高那么多，大那么多，你才休想叫我那么尊敬他。在某些时候，某些场合，达西是个再讨厌不过的家伙──特别是礼拜天晚上在他家里，当他没有事情做的时候。”
　　Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.　　	达西微笑了一下，伊丽莎白本来要笑，可是觉得他好象有些生气了，便忍住了没有笑。彬格莱小姐看见人家拿他开玩笑，很是生气，便怪她的哥哥干吗要谈这样没意思的话。
　　"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend. -- "You dislike an argument, and want to silence this."　　	达西说：“我明白你的用意，彬格莱，你不喜欢辩论，要把这场辩论压下去。”
　　"perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."　　	“我也许真是这样。辩论往往很象争论，假若你和班纳特小姐能够稍缓一下等我走出房间以后再，辩论那我是非常感激的。我走出去以后，你们便可以爱怎么说我就怎么说我了。”
　　"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter,"　　	伊丽莎白说：“你要这样做，对我并没有什么损失；达西先生还是去把信写好吧。”
　　When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.　　	这件事过去以后，达西要求彬格莱小姐和伊丽莎白小姐赏赐他一点音乐听听，彬格莱小姐便敏捷地走钢琴跟前，先客气了一番，请伊丽莎白带头，伊丽莎白却更加客气、更加诚恳地推辞了，然后彬格莱小姐才在琴旁坐下来。
　　Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine however, at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation.　　	赫斯脱太太替她妹妹伴唱。当她们姐妹俩演奏的时候，伊丽莎白翻阅着钢琴上的几本琴谱，只见达西先生的眼睛总是望着她。如果说，这位了不起的人这样看着她是出于爱慕之意，她可不大敢存这种奢望，不过，要是说达西是因为讨厌她所以才望着她，那就更说不通了。最后，她只得这样想;她所以引起了达西的注意，大概是因为达西认为她比起在座的任何人来，都叫人看不顺眼。她作出了这个假想之后，并没有感到痛苦，因为她根本不喜欢他，因此不稀罕他的垂青。
　　After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her --　　	彬格莱小姐弹了几支意大利歌曲以后，便改弹了一些活泼的苏格兰曲子来变换变换情调。不大一会儿工夫，达西先生走到伊丽莎白跟前来，跟她说：
　　"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"　　	“班纳特小姐，你是不是很想趁这个机会来跳一次苏格兰舞？”
　　She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.　　	伊丽莎白没有回答他，只是笑了笑。他见她闷声不响，觉得有点儿奇怪，便又问了她一次。
　　"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say "Yes," that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have therefore made up my mind to tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all -- and now despise me if you dare."　　	“噢，”她说，“我早就听见了;可是我一下子拿不准应该怎样回答你。当然，我知道你希望我回答一声‘是的’那你就会蔑视我的低级趣味，好让你自己得意一番，只可惜我一向喜欢戳穿人家的诡计，作弄一下那些存心想要蔑视人的人。因此，我决定跟你说，我根本不爱跳苏格兰舞;这一下你可不敢蔑视我了吧。”
　　Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.　　	伊丽莎白本来打算使他难堪一下，这会儿见他那么体贴，倒楞住了。不过，伊丽莎白的为人一贯温柔乖巧，不轻易得罪任何人，而达西又对她非常着迷，以前任何女人也不曾使他这样着迷过。他不由得一本正经地想道，要不是她的亲戚出身微贱，那我难免危险了。
　　Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.　　	彬格莱小姐见到这般光景，很是嫉妒，或者也可以说是她疑心病重，因此由疑而妒。于是她愈想把伊丽莎白撵走，就愈巴不得她的好朋友吉英病体赶快复元。
　　She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.　　	为了挑拨达西厌恶这位客人，她常常闲言闲语，说他跟伊丽莎白终将结成美满良缘，而且估料着这一门良缘会给达西带来多大幸福。
　　"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers. -- And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses."　　	第二天彬格莱小姐跟达西两人在矮树林里散步，彬格莱小姐说：“我希望将来有一天好事如愿的时候，你得委婉地奉劝你那位岳母出言吐语要谨慎些，还有你那几位小姨子，要是你能力办得到，最好也得把她们那种醉心追求军官的毛病医治好。还有一件事，我真不好意思说出口；尊夫人有一点儿小脾气，好象是自高自大，又好象是不懂礼貌，你也得尽力帮助她克制一下。”　
　　"Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"　　	“关于促进我的家庭幸福方面，你还有什么别的意见吗？”
　　"Oh! yes. -- Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley. put them next to your great uncle, the judge. They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"　　	“噢，有的是。千万把你姨丈人姨丈母的像挂到彭伯里画廊里面去，就挂在你那位当法官的伯祖父大人遗象旁边。你知道他们都是同行，只不过部门不同而已。至于尊夫人伊丽莎白，可千万别让别人替她画像，天下哪一个画家能够把她那一双美丽的眼睛画得维妙维肖？”
　　"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied."　　	“那双眼睛的神气确不容易描画；可是眼睛的形状和颜色，以及她的睫毛，都非常美妙，也许描画得出来。”
　　At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself.　　	他们正谈得起劲和时候，忽然看见赫斯脱太太和伊丽莎白从另外一条路走过来。
　　"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.　　	彬格莱小姐连忙招呼她们说：“我不知道你们也想出来散散步，”她说这话的时候，心里很有些惴惴不安，因为她恐怕刚才的话让她们听见了。
　　"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "in running away without telling us that you were coming out." Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three.　　	“你们也太对不起我们了，”赫斯脱太太回答道，“只顾自己出来，也不告诉我们一声。”接着她就挽住达西空着的那条臂膀，丢下伊丽莎白，让她独个儿去走。这条路恰巧只容得下三个人并排走。
　　"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue."　　	“这条路太窄，不能让我们大家一块儿并排走，我们不是走到大道上去吧。”
　　But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered,　　	伊丽莎白本不想跟他们待在一起，一听这话，便笑嘻嘻地说：
　　"No, no; stay where you are. -- You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good bye."　　	“不用啦，不用啦；你们就在这儿走走吧。你们三个人在一起走非常好看，而且很出色。加上第四个人，画面就给弄毁了。再见。”
　　She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.　　	于是她就得意洋洋地跑开了。她一面跪溜达，一面想到一两天内就可以回家，觉得很高兴。吉英的病已经大为好转，当天晚上就想走出房间去玩它两个钟头。

Before you start reading, ask yourself why are you reading this book. Most people read for two main reasons – pleasure or knowledge.	在阅读以前问问自己：为何要读这本书。大部分的人读书有两个原因——兴趣或者知识。
Being specific and clear about your reading purpose not only helps you to eliminate books that you don't need to read. It also reminds you why reading the book is important to you as you are reading it. This motivates you to keep reading and complete the book faster.	清楚自己的阅读目标不仅能帮你排除你不需要读的书，也能在你阅读的时候提醒你阅读这本书的重要性。这种动机能让你一直阅读，并且能更快速地读完。
Whether you are reading fiction or nonfiction, it's important to enjoy what you read. Your friends may recommend books that they love, but those books might not necessarily be the ones you enjoy.	不管是小说类还是非小说类，重要的是要喜欢你所读的。你朋友可能推荐的是他们喜欢读的，但是这些书可能不一定是你喜欢读的。　
You may have selected books that are aligned with your purpose. You may have selected books that you are attracted to. But as you are reading them, there may still be some books that you won't enjoy reading.	也许选书的时候你是带着一定的目的性的，也许你是因为喜欢才选的。但是当你阅读的时候，有些书可能就不是你喜欢读的。
Whenever you realize that you aren't enjoying the book you are reading, give it up. Remember reading shouldn't be a chore.	不管你在什么时候发现你不喜欢读正在读的这本书，那就不读了。记住。阅读不应该让你心烦。
Having a reading goal helps you figure out how much reading you need to do in a week or even a day.	有阅读目标能帮你弄清楚一周或一天需要阅读多少。
Before you read each book, ask yourself when you need to complete this book by.	在你阅读每一本书的时候，问你自己什么时候得完成这本书的阅读。
What I find interesting is that I tend to read books that I borrow from libraries faster than the books I bought. The reason is the books I bought don't have a due date! I don't need to return those books.	我发现一个有趣的事情就是从图书馆借来的书会读得比我自己买的书更快。原因是我买的书没有归还日期。我不必还书。
When you don't set a deadline to complete your book. There isn't a sense of urgency. And when something isn't urgent, you tend to procrastinate.	当你没有设定一个读完书的截止日期的时候，就会觉得不急。当事情变得不紧急的时候，你就会拖延。
　　ELIZABETH passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.
　　	伊丽莎白那一晚上的大部分时间都是在她姐姐房间里度过的，第二天一大早，彬格莱先生就派了个女佣人来问候她们。过了一会儿，彬格莱的姐姐妹妹也打发了两个文雅的侍女来探病，伊丽莎白总算可以聊以自慰地告诉她们说，病人已略见好转。不过，她虽然宽了一下心，却还是要求他们府上替她差人送封信到浪博恩去，要她的妈妈来看看吉英，来亲自判断她的病情如何。信立刻就送去了，信上所说的事也很快就照办了。班纳特太太带着两个最小的女儿来到尼日斐花园的时候，他们家里刚刚吃过早饭。
　　Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her, that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.
　　	倘使班纳特太太发觉吉英有什么危险，那她真要伤心死了;但是一看到吉英的病并不怎么严重，她就满意了;她也并不希望吉英马上复元，因为，要是一复元，她就得离开尼日斐花园回家去。所以她的女儿一提起要她带她回家去，她听也不要听，况且那位差不多跟她同时来到的医生，也认为搬回去不是个好办法。母亲陪着吉英坐了一会儿工夫，彬格莱小姐便来请她吃早饭，于是她就带着三个女儿一块儿上饭厅去。彬格莱先生前来迎接她们，说是希望班纳特太太看到了小姐的病一定会觉得并不是想象中那般严重。
　　"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer. "She is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness."
    	班纳特太太回答道：“我却没有想象到会这般严重呢，先生，她病得太厉害了，根本不能搬动。钟斯大夫也说，千万不可以叫她搬动。我们只得叨光你们多照顾几天啦。”
　　"Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal."
    	“搬动！”彬格莱叫道：“绝对不可以。我相信我的妹妹也决计不肯让她搬走的。”
　　"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us."
    	彬格莱小姐冷淡而有礼貌地说：“你放心好啦，老太太，班纳特小姐待在我们这儿，我们一定尽心尽意地照顾她。”
　　"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world -- which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease."
　　	接着她又说道：“要不是靠好朋友们照顾，我相信她真不知道变成什么样儿了;因为她实在病得很重，痛苦得很厉害，不过好在她有极大的耐性──她一贯都是那样的，我生平简直没见过第二个人有她这般温柔到极点的性格。我常常跟别的几个女儿们说，她们比起她来简直太差了。彬格莱先生，你这所房子很可爱呢，从那条鹅卵石铺道上望出去，景致也很美丽。在这个村庄里，我从来没见过一个地方比得上尼日斐花园。虽然你的租期很短，我劝你千万别急着搬走。”
　　"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."
    	彬格莱先生说：“我随便干什么事，都是说干就干，要是打定主意要离开尼日斐花园，我可能在五分钟之内就搬走。不过目前我算在这儿住定了。”
　　"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.
    	彬格莱马上转过身去对她大声说道：“你开始了解我啦，是吗？”
　　"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful."
    	“但愿你这句话是恭维我，不过，这么容易被人看透，那恐怕也是件可怜的事吧。”
　　"That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."
    	“那得看情况说话。一个深沉复杂的人，未必比你这样的人更难叫人捉摸。”
　　"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."
    	她的母亲连忙嚷道：“丽萃，别忘了你在作客，家里让你撒野惯了，你可不能到人家这里来胡闹。”
　　"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study."
    	“我以前倒不知道你是个研究人的性格的专家。”彬格莱马上接下去说，“那一定是一门很有趣的学问吧。”
　　"Yes; but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at least that advantage."
    	“不错；可是最有趣味的还是研究复杂的性格。至少这样的性格有研究的价值。”
　　"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society."
    	达西说：“一般说来，乡下人可以作为这种研究对象的就很少。因为在乡下，你四周围的人都是非常不开通、非常单调。”
　　"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever."
   	“可是人们本身的变动很多，他们身上永远有新的东西值得你去注意。”
　　"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. "I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town."
    	班纳特太太听到刚刚达西以那样一种口气提到乡下，不禁颇为生气，便连忙嚷道：“这才说得对呀，告诉你吧，乡下可供研究的对象并不比城里少。”
　　Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.
    	大家都吃了一惊。达西朝她望了一会儿便静悄悄地走开了。班纳特太太自以为完全占了他的上风，便趁着一股兴头说下去：
　　"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?"
    	“我觉得伦敦除了店铺和公共场所以外，比起乡下并没有什么大不了的好处。乡下可舒服得多了──不是吗，彬格莱先生？”
　　"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."
    	“我到了乡下就不想走，”他回答道;“我住到城里也就不想走。乡下和城里各有各的好处，我随便住在哪儿都一样快乐。”
　　"Aye -- that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all."
    	“啊，那是因为你的性格好。可是那位先生，”她说到这里，便朝达西望了一眼，“就会觉得乡下一文不值。”
　　"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true."
    	“妈妈，你根本弄错了，”伊丽莎白这话一出口，她母亲就红了脸。“你完全弄错了达西先生的意思。他只不过说，乡下碰不到象城里那么些各色名样的人，这你可得承认是事实呀。”
　　"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four and twenty families."
    	“当然罗，宝贝──谁也没那么说过。要是说这个村子里还碰不到多少人，我相信比这大的村庄也就没有几个了。就我所知，平常跟我们来往吃饭的可也有二十四家呀。”
　　Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away.
    	要不是顾全伊丽莎白的面子，彬格莱先生简直忍不住要笑出来了。他的妹妹可没有他那么用心周到，便不由得带着富有表情的笑容望着达西先生。伊丽莎为了找个借口转移一下她母亲的心思，便问她母亲说，自从她离家以后，夏绿蒂·卢卡斯有没有到浪博恩来过。
　　"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley -- is not he? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy! -- He has always something to say to every body. -- That is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."
    	“来过；她是昨儿跟他父亲一块儿来的。威廉爵士是个多么和蔼的人呀，彬格莱先生──他可不是吗？那么时髦的一个人！那么温雅，又那么随便！他见到什么人总要谈上儿句。这就是我所谓的有良好教养；那些自以为了不起、金口难开的人，他们的想法真是大错而特错。”
　　"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up differently. But every body is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so very plain -- but then she is our particular friend."
　　	“没有，她硬要回去。据我猜想，大概是她家里街头等着她回去做肉饼。彬格莱先生，我雇起佣人来，总得要她们能够料理份内的事，我的女儿就不是人家那样教养大的。可是一切要看各人自己，告诉你，卢卡斯家里的几个姑娘全是些很好的女孩子。只可惜长得不漂亮！当然并不是我个人以为夏绿蒂长得难看，她究竟是我们要好的朋友。”
　　"Oh! dear, yes; -- but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane -- one does not often see any body better looking. It is what every body says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But however he did not. perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."
    	“是呀，可是你得承认，她的确长得很难看。卢卡斯太太本人也那么说，她还羡慕我的吉英长得漂亮呢。我并不喜欢夸张自己的孩子，可是说老实话。这并不是我说话有信心。还在她十五岁的那一年，在我城里那位兄弟嘉丁纳家里，有位先生就爱上了她，我的弟妇看准了那位先生一定会在临走以前向她求婚。不过后来他却没有提。也许是他以为她年纪太小了吧。不过他却为吉英写了好些诗，而且写得很好。”
　　"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently. "There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"
    	“那位先生的一场恋爱就这么结束了，”伊丽莎白不耐烦地说。“我想，多少有情人都是这样把自己克服过来的。诗居然有这种功能──能够赶走爱情，这倒不知道是谁第一个发现的！”
　　"I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love," said Darcy.
    	“我却一贯认为，诗是爱情的食粮，”达西说。
　　"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Every thing nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."
    	“那必须是一种优美、坚贞、健康的爱情才行。本身健强了，吃什么东西都可以获得滋补。要是只不过有一点儿蛛丝马迹，那么我相信，一首十四行诗准会把它断送掉。”
　　Darcy only smiled, and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part, indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.
　　	达西只笑了一下，接着大伙儿都沉默了一阵子，这时候伊丽莎白很是着急，怕她母亲又要出丑。她想说点儿什么，可是又想不出什么可说的。沉默了一下以后，班纳特太太又重新向彬格莱先生道谢，说是多亏他对吉英照顾周到，同时又向他道歉说，丽萃也来打扰了他。彬格莱先生回答得极其恳切而有礼貌，弄得他的妹妹也不得不讲礼貌，说了些很得体的话。她说话的态度并不十分自然，可是班纳特太太已经够满意的了。一会儿工夫，班纳特太太就叫预备马车。这个号令一发，她那位顶小的女儿立刻走上前来。原来自从她们母女来到此地，两个女儿就一直在交头接耳地商量，最后说定了由顶小的女儿来要求彬格莱先生兑现他刚以乡下时的诺言，在尼日斐花园开一次跳舞会。
　　Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.
　　	丽迪雅是个胖胖的、发育得很好的姑娘，今年才十五岁，细皮白肉，笑颜常开，她是母亲的掌上明珠，由于娇纵过度，她很小就进入了社交界。她生性好动，天生有些不知分寸，加上她的姨爹一次次以美酒嘉肴宴请那些军官们，军官们又见她颇有几分浪荡的风情，便对她发生了相当好感，于是她更加肆无忌惮了。所以她就有资格向彬格莱先生提出开舞会的事，而且冒冒失失地提醒他先前的诺言，而且还说，要是他不实践诺言，那就是天下最丢人的事。彬格莱先生对她这一番突如其来的挑衅回答得叫她母亲很是高兴。
　　"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement, and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."
　　	“我可以向你保证，我非常愿意实践我的诺言;只要等你姐姐复了元，由你随便订个日期就行。你总不愿意在姐姐生病的时候跳舞吧？！”
　　Lydia declared herself satisfied. "Oh! yes -- it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given your ball," she added, "I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."
　　	丽迪雅表示满意。“你这话说得不错。等到吉英复元以后再跳，那真好极了，而且到那时候，卡特尔上尉也许又可能回到麦里屯来。等你开过舞会以后，我一定非要他们也开一次不可。我一定会跟弗斯脱上校说，要是他不开，可真丢人哪。”
　　Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on fine eyes.
　　	于是班纳特太太带着她的两个女儿走了。伊丽莎白立刻回到吉英身边去，也不去管彬格莱府上的两位小姐怎样在背后议论她跟她家里人有失体统。不过，尽管彬格莱小姐怎么样说俏皮话，怎么样拿她的“美丽的眼睛”开玩笑，达西却始终不肯受她们的怂恿，夹在她们一起来编排她的不是。
The story goes that two friends were walking through the desert. During some point of the journey they had an argument, and one friend slapped the other one in the face.
	话说两个好朋友正在穿越一个沙漠。途中他们忽然争吵了起来，其中一个一巴掌扇在另一个人的脸上。
The one who got slapped was hurt, but without saying anything, he wrote in the sand: "Today my best friend slapped me in the face."
	被扇的那个人受了伤害，但他一句话也没有说，只是在沙子上写道：“今天我最要好的朋友打了我一个耳光。”
They kept on walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath. The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but the friend saved him.
	他们继续走下去，后来发现了一片绿洲，他们于是决定洗个澡。先前被打的那个人这时不小心陷入了泥潭里面，差点被淹死，幸运的是他的朋友把他给救了出来。
After he recovered from the near drowning, he wrote on a stone: "Today my best friend saved my life."
	他苏醒过来后，立刻在一块石头上写道：“今天我最要好的朋友救了我一命。”
The friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him, "After I hurt you, you wrote in the sand and now you write on a stone. Why?"
	扇他耳光又救过他性命的朋友于是问他说：“我打了你之后你在沙子上写字，而现在你却在石头上写，为什么呢？”
The other friend replied: "When someone hurts us we should write it down in the sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in a stone where no wind can ever erase it."
	写字的那个人回答说：“当我们被别人伤害了之后，我们应该把它写在沙子上，那样，宽容的风就很快就会将其抹去，但当我们受到别人的帮助之后，我们必须将它刻在石头上，那样，风就不会轻易把它磨灭。”
Learn to write your hurts in the sand and to carve your benefits in the stone.
	学会将你所受到的伤害写在沙子上，把别人给你的帮助记在石头上。
They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them, but an entire life to forget them.
	人们常说，发掘一个特别的人需要一分钟，欣赏一个人需要一个小时，爱上一个人需要一整天，但忘记一个人却需要你一生的时间。

Send this phrase to the people you'll never forget. It's a short message to let them know that you'll never forget them.
	将这句话发给你永远不会忘怀的人吧，让他们知道你将永远把他们放在心上。
Heading Stateside for your own voyage of discovery? Take some inspiration from a couple of these titles. 	即将去美利坚开启你的探索之旅吗？先来读读下面这几本书获得一点启发吧。
Published in 1957, Kerouac’s masterpiece captured the voice of America’s ‘Beat Generation’, an iconoclastic group of writers that sprung up in the post-war US as a reaction against mainstream social values:materialism, capitalist accumulation, passive acceptance of religious and ethical codes. On the Road describes the whistle-stop travels of Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty. The story is enriched by the clarity of Kerouac’s spontaneous prose, yet has resounded with young readers to this day for its underlying values of exploration, experimentalism, and the (ultimately fruitless) search for true value in life. 	凯鲁亚克在1957年出版的这部杰作发出了美国“垮掉的一代”的声音，这一派作家的思想有悖于传统信仰，在二战后的美国迅速崛起，反应了对战后祖国主流价值观，即物质主义、资本积累、对宗教和道德准则的被动接受等的抗议。《在路上》描绘了萨尔（Sal Paradise）与狄安（Dean Moriarty）的美国之行。凯鲁亚克的散文自然真切，也因为故事内在的价值观——探索、尝试、（虽说最后没有成功却）不断寻找生命的真实意义等——一直引起年轻读者的共鸣。
Arguably Nobel Prize-winning American writer John Steinbeck’s greatest work, The Grapes of Wrath follows the fortunes of the Joads, a family of Oklahoman farmers forced to flee their Dust Bowl home during the Great Depression. On the road to California, they encounter hunger, poverty, abandonment, and exploitation, yet also great generosity, sacrifice, maturity, and finally rebirth. Upon publication, the novel’s accessible prose and sensitivity to the plight of America’s labouring poor both resonated with the country’s working classes and aroused the ire of some of Steinbeck’s contemporaries. A true paean to the power of the human spirit, it is studied in high school English classrooms to this day. 《	愤怒的葡萄》可以说是诺贝尔文学奖获得者、美国作家约翰·史坦贝克最出色的长篇小说，故事描写了约德家族的兴衰。20世纪30年代大萧条时期，这个俄克拉荷马州的农家因为其农场位于美国中部的“灰盆”（当时因为气候原因频繁爆发大规模沙尘暴），被迫逃离家园。在走向加州的路上，他们遭遇了饥饿，贫穷，被遗弃和剥削等悲惨经历，同时也见证了同胞的慷慨、牺牲、成熟和最后的重生。小说刚刚出版时，因史坦贝克的文笔朴实感性，体恤民情，引起了美国工人阶级的共鸣，但同时也激起了一些同时代人士的怒火。这部小说歌颂了人文精神的力量，迄今都是美国学生英语课堂里的必学材料。
3. Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance 《	禅与摩托车维修艺术》，罗伯特·梅纳德·波西格著
Simultaneously a thrilling piece of travel literature and a philosophical treatise, Robert M. Pirsig’s 1974 novel Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance traces the author’s bike trip from Minnesota to California. Interspersed with vivid sweeps of the American prairies, each chapter also chronicles a series of philosophical discussions as a father recovering from electroconvulsive therapy gradually tries to reconcile his own worldviews with those of the people around him and liberation from a materialist spiritual vacuum. Drawing on both the Western and Eastern philosophical canon, this challenging read ultimately serves as a platform for Pirsig to introduce his own Metaphysics of Quality. 	这是一部很有意思的旅游文学作品，也可以被看作一篇哲学论文。波西格74年出版的长篇小说《禅与摩托车维修艺术》描绘了作者从美国明尼苏达州到加州的一段骑行之旅。除了对北美莽莽大草原的生动描述，每一章里，波西格还针对一系列哲理性话题进行了探讨。随着作者的讨论，主人公——一位从电痉挛治疗中逐渐恢复的父亲，不断尝试协调自己和周围人的世界观，并试图摆脱物质文化带给他的空虚感。波西格借用东西方的哲学论点，阐述了自己的“质量形而上学论”，虽然要看懂相当不易，一旦读完却绝对会受益匪浅。
Alice Walker’s Pulitzer Prize-winning epistolary novel The Color Purple won huge acclaim for its sensitive exploration of the lives of African-American women in America’s Deep South during the 1930s. Set in rural Georgia, Celie, the novel’s protagonist, suffers immense abuse and victimisation as a black girl growing up in a racially segregated community. Later, her meeting with Shug Avery, a glitzy singer and magic-maker, helps Celie push back against the repressive society around her and take charge of her own destiny. 	由爱丽丝·沃克所著，曾获普利策文学奖的书信体小说《紫色姐妹花》，因其对30年代居住于美国南方腹地的非裔美国女性生活的感性探讨，备受称赞。故事发生于乔治亚州的乡村地区，当时因种族隔离制度，小说的黑人女主角西丽（Celie）在成长过程中遭受了大量的虐待和迫害。后来，她认识了一位耀眼的歌手兼魔术师阿弗利（Shug Avery），由此开始抵抗这个压抑的社会并主动掌握自己的命运。
A novel of diffuse influences and phenomenal imaginative power, Philip K. Dick’s The Man in the High Castle challenged the foundations of American exceptionalism. Dick postulates an alternate ending to the Second World War, one which witnessed the defeat of the Allies, the conquest of the American continent by the Japanese Empire and Nazi Germany, and the subsequent Cold War ‘fought’ between the two new Axis Powers. Suffused with East Asian philosophy, and featuring passages written in stunning Japanese-English creole, the book explores the veracity of the reality we live in, how we negotiate ‘true’ or ‘fake’ identities in the face of persecution, and how much true ‘value’ can be derived from any sense of national pride. 	这本小说的灵感集众家之长，作家的想象力也令人赞叹。《高堡奇人》挑战了“美国例外主义”的基本原则。迪克在书中假设二战有了另外一种结局，反法西斯同盟被打败，全北美洲都被日本帝国和纳粹德国所征服，接下来这两大轴心国之间便开始“冷战”。整本书充满了东亚哲学原理，还包含了迪克自编的令人惊叹的“日英混合语”。作者通过创造这个平行世界，探讨了现实世界的真实性，人们面对迫害表达个性的方式，以及从民族自豪感中到底能获得多少真实“价值”。

In the world of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger is the one that got away ... for the books' number one champion, that is.	在《哈利·波特》的世界里，赫敏·格兰杰就是那个没有和一号英雄在一起的人。
Though I treasured J.K. Rowling's incomparable series from middle school until my second year of college, I was ready to move on from the franchise a long time ago, so when the author keeps popping up in the news to discuss what we didn't know or what she should have done with the story, it feels a little unnecessary, and honestly, I worry the old favorite of mine has become an itch that won't go away with all these delayed talks on its creation.J·K·	罗琳无与伦比的《哈利·波特》系列是我从中学珍视到大二的杰作，但许久之前我已开始淡漠这一特趣，所以每当作者在新闻里喋喋不休地讨论观众未知的情节或絮叨剧情应怎样设定时，我就觉得毫无必要，老实说，我担心原来中意的版本会碍人眼球，最终被作者和着迟来的讨论改编得面目俱毁。
Yet everyone's buzzing about Rowling's recent interview revealing the Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger pairing was a mistake. Hermione, a plucky, highly intelligent female wizard, should have wound up with Harry Potter, the leading man. Rowling says this is how she intended for the story to play out:	近来，因为罗琳在采访中透露罗恩·韦斯莱与赫敏·格兰杰是对儿错误鸳鸯，立即引得人们议论纷纷。赫敏，一个勇敢、天资聪慧的女巫，应该和哈利·波特这样的领导型人才在一起。罗琳说她当初如此安排故事是因为：
"I wrote the Hermione/Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment. That's how it was conceived, really. For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron."	“我是出于实现一种愿望才将赫敏和罗恩凑成对的。这就是故事的构思，真的。它与文学无太大关系，更多的在于我构思时便倾向于这种结果，赫敏和罗恩在一起的结果。”
Many of us rooted for Harry and Hermione to get together from the start, and Rowling worries her confession has upset a lot of fans who are probably thinking, " I told you so":	我们多数人从一开始就支持哈利和赫敏在一起，而罗琳近来的困惑和担忧的确伤了很多粉丝的心，他们似乎在抱怨，“我早告诉你了”：
"I know, I'm sorry. I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some fans, but if I'm absolutely honest, distance has given me perspective on that. It was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for reasons of credibility. Am I breaking people's hearts by saying this? I hope not."	“我知道，对不起。我能听到一些粉丝的愤怒和懊恼，但如果我绝对诚实，我就要说距离给了我观察的视角。之前的选择是出于我的个人原因，而非为了赚取诚信。我这么说有没有伤某些人的心呢？但愿没有。”
To be honest, we all would have been perfectly OK to not know, and as much as I cherish the books, this isn't the best way to keep their spirit alive.	说实话，我们所有人最好都不要知道发生过这样的事，我也为此书送上至高的祝福，但现在的争执并非是让主人翁精神永存的最佳方式。
From my standpoint, it would have seemed too obvious for Harry and Hermione to date. There's also something special about the complex relationship between Hermione and Ron, two completely different people. Hermione is ambitious, prompt, sharp whereas Ron is painted as the dopey accident-prone ginger with no money and a ton of siblings. He has the big loving family, but you never really hear about her home life. She's more book smart, he's more street smart. Harry, on the other hand, falls somewhere in the middle, having lost his parents as a baby and also struggled when he first got to Hogwarts. Ron and Hermione balance each other out as many polar opposites do.	从我的观点来看，哈利和赫敏非常登对。当然赫敏和罗恩间同样存在着某些特别的、复杂的情愫，两人又是两个世界的人。赫敏野心勃勃、敏捷、犀利，而罗恩却被描述成一个迟钝的麻瓜，贫穷而且兄弟姐妹众多。他有一个温暖的大家庭，但你几乎听不到有关她的家庭状况。她通四书，他晓社会。而哈利，就是此二人的综合版，从小失去了双亲，初到霍格沃茨时同样受尽磨练。罗恩和赫敏能够像阴阳两极那样弥补对方的不足。
Taking romance out of the equation, Harry Potter isn't a story driven by who belongs with whom. It's a book about many things, and the love aspect is a very small part of the plot. While Rowling is the writer and should be able to talk about her work however she'd like, Harry Potter means something different to every single person who reads or watches it. There's no use trying to alter these memories so many years after the fact or for new people who haven't had the chance to experience the series yet. Let's honor it for what it was, not for what it could have been.	抛开浪漫，《哈利·波特》并不是一本研究谁属于谁的小说。它涵盖许多方面，而爱情只是其中相当小的一部分。而作为作者的罗琳当然可以随心地谈论自己的作品咯，但对于读过或者观看过《哈利·波特》的每一个单独的人来讲，它却是心头那特别的一块。所以，时隔多年已无意义去改变过去的记忆，或因为那已成事实，或因为新人再无体味的机会。我们唯有缅怀曾经的存在，不再去执迷未成的结局。
Fascinated by the myth of Pegasus, and the famously untameable African zebra, Alice Shirley reinvents the classical legend, transporting it to southern Africa. The celestial mount of Zeus brought forth the fountain of the Muses with a kick of his hoof, and was turned into a constellation by the king of the gods. Here, he swaps his immaculate (	完美的) white coat for the two-tone pattern of his close equine cousins. Completing this highly original portrait, his magnificent wings turn flaming orange, echoing the plumage of African parrots。
The clock strikes twelve. Midnight in Paris, and the city seems calm and quiet. But a signal beams out from the Eiffel Tower: a call to Super H! Something’s afoot (	准备中). Masked and cloaked, the proud horse atop the Hermès building undergoes a strange metmorphosis, ready for action. We watch breathlessly as he prepares to take flight – a modern Pegasus for the world of the comic strip。
Riding high on the racehorses of the world, the jockey’s traditional attire has been transformed and simplified since the nineteenth century. Heavy riding coats were replaced by lightweight, brightly coloured ’silks’, boots replaced buckled slippers, and black riding hats decked with fluttering ribbons gave way to the familiar jockey’s cap. The riders’ comfort has greatly improved, and racecourses everywhere are bright with the vivid colours of each racehorse owner’s distinctive silk. Increasing numbers of owners led to a bewildering array of colour combinations and motifs until the introduction of precise rules, in 1900. Circling the silhouettes (	轮廓) of jockeys in the heat of the race, a festive, multicoloured dance of caps fills the space of the square, punctuated with lucky horseshoes at each corner. Because even the greatest talent sometimes needs a little luck。

Take a break from the classic dinner and a movie routine with one of these original ideas.	十二月的严寒已慢慢逼近，你的约会点子也需要更富有创意一些！在天台上喝饮料或者去公园野餐似乎都不大现实了，不过，这里我们列出了一些有趣而实惠的选择，不管外面的温度有多低，都能让你的社交生活活跃起来。是时候换换传统的共进晚餐或是平淡乏味的电影约会了，试试这些新颖的点子吧！
You don't have to completely forget about summer in cold winter days. Embark on an exotic adventure with a visit to the aquarium. Aquariums are romantic because of the dim lighting and dreamy seascapes.	即使在寒冷的冬天，也不要把夏天统统抛在脑后。参观水族馆就像开启了一场颇具异域风情的冒险之旅。昏暗的灯光与梦幻般的海景都让海洋馆成为浪漫之地。
Watching comedy is a fun way to get away from the cold and bond over cheap laughs. In small improv troupes, comedians are given ridiculous scenarios to act out on the spot.	看场喜剧表演也是个摆脱寒冷的不错选择：两个人一起因为一些没深度的笑话而捧腹，彼此间的距离也因此变得亲密。在一些小型即兴表演剧团里，喜剧演员们经常会带来现场的滑稽情景表演。
It's common knowledge that including anything rock 'n' roll on your date makes you look cooler. And if the performance fits your taste, great. If not, research shows people develop feelings for each other more quickly when they have a mutual dislike in common. So it's a win-win.	众所周知，一旦约会中加入了摇滚元素，就会让你看起来更酷；如果表演恰好正合你们的口味，那就更棒了。而研究表明，即使演出不合口味，两个人的感情也会因为共同的不喜欢而迅速升温。所以这是个双赢的好点子。
Hit up the library or a bookstore. Show each other your favorite books from your childhood. Read some of your all-time favorite passages. It's the best way to learn about your partner's interests.	逛逛图书馆或者书店。两个人互相给对方介绍从儿时起自己最喜欢的书籍；读读那些一直以来你最爱的段落。这是了解你另一半兴趣的最好方式。
It's cliché to watch a film at a cinema, and who hasn't already had a movie marathon at home? Why not make a standard movie night a little more interesting by adding a theme to the mix: favorite movie couple, favorite movie that's so bad it's good, scariest movie ever made ... you get the idea. Each of you picks your top contender, and then you can flip for who goes first.	去电影院看电影早就没创意了，而且谁还没在家里“跑”过电影马拉松呢？你还可以给千篇一律的电影之夜加一个主题，让它变得更有趣：比如“最喜爱银幕情侣的电影”，“权把坏片当好片的最喜爱电影”，以及“史上最吓人电影”等等，不管怎样，主题都由你们自己定。两个人都挑出自己的“最佳私藏”，然后一决高下看看谁的更胜一筹。
Cold weather calls for comfort food and, luckily, making soup can be a great date idea that doesn't require much culinary skill. Make the soup from scratch or buy a bunch of frozen beans, corn and carrots and other veggies, and dump them in the pot. Either way, you'll have something to do together that's not too challenging, and a lovely soup dinner to look forward to.	寒冷的天气需要美食的慰藉，幸运的是，煲汤这个极佳的约会点子对烹饪技巧的要求并不高。你们可以从洗菜开始，也可以买一堆速冻的豆子、玉米、胡萝卜以及其他蔬菜，然后将其一股脑倒进锅里。不管怎么样，你们总算有了一件可以一起做的事，而且难度系数不高，还有一顿甜蜜的热汤晚餐可以期待。
